  For "VHMR" (360-degree-Video-HMR), I think the steps should be (all modular as possible:
    Cut up
    Get best-estimated SMPL object out of the single image
    Store all the betas in one data structure and take the median, mean, [insert some "sensibly calculated" middle value](really just means whatever betas minimize L2 error (haha, as if it were possible to know this without access to the CAESAR dataset)), etc.
