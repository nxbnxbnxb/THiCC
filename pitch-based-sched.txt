*CVC FINAL ROUND* 
------------------
*PIPELINE FOR APRIL 3RD*
-------------------

It will be a group pitch: each of us will have a section where they will talk. In order to keep constancy, one will write the speech, and after each will review and slightly modify their part according what they think is better.
The concept of the speech will be that all of us will have oversized clothes (they will be the same type strippers use). After we introduce the problem, we will rip off our clothes (they are made to be ripped off), and we will show perfect-sized suits (buy one if you don't have any), and will introduce the solution of The Mall. It will be really scenic so be ready to act.
