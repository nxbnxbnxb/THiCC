  Mistakes:
    Procrastinating too much on implementing triangle area
    Perhaps I should have copied the code for n-sided polygon area?
  Successes!
    Triangle-area() seems to work!  I should probably scan the notes I used into pdfs and put them on my website or something...


  As of 4:07 P.M., I plan to double-check the triangle area a different way and then move on to implementing Delaunay Triangulation of an arbitrary set of points.  DTri is better than the convexHull b.c. cHull doesn't work for concave polygons
    Try it with this (http://www.qhull.org/html/qdelaun.htm)  if there's nothing in python/if python's implementation is too slow.

  3 mistakes today:
    I went to UD Smith Hall (comp sci)
    I was too disorganized.  Didn't write code agile-ly enough.  Always just start start start and then keep going

  Accelerators?
  Get out an MVP and start pitching it?

  The best result is if we can find/transition to something 100% remote so I can move to California whenever it's convenient later.

    Also ideal if something matches all my skillsets (automation, rather than brainless work like at Burger King)
      Probably apply to Newark/Philly software jobs.

  The second-best result is probably Tesla, even if it's not a tech position
    If it comes to a permanent role, try to discuss with the guys in person rather than via text (better to explain why, all the details, etc.)

  Mall proj:

    Copy Dario's 3-month plan
      Go to a UD prof & ask about debugging deep learning

    1st, get conda working with seg.py again.
      Then, generalize the rotation process and angle-finding.
    Thereafter, try to get a general idea of how long this thing will take




























  What mistakes did you make today?
    Can we learn anything from them?  If so, what?

  Tell Vishal what I've learned?
  Maybe he just won't listen.  He has to make the mistakes himself to learn.





























    1)  Start looking
    2)  Make a giant list
    3)  Apply in a giant one-shot (as much as possible)

  Technical (today):
    We're trying to get measurements from a single picture.  Then we can use SMPL to replicate a body with those measurements.
    Consider simple color-filtering to acquire clothing measurements (one set of poses with just skintight neutrally-colored clothing, another with the clothing they wanna sell & they pick a point on it for us to "segment out" using HSV)

  List out all TODOs on Zoho
    Either 
      a)  Steal Tubingen's tech
        I think we're doing this
        OpenPose to get measurements instead of the shittier segmentation where I have to do sizing myself
      b)  Switch to plain sizing
      c)  Take a lot longer to finish


  Technical:
    Find the waist length.
    Get the "best" segmentation from the first few frames of the video

    Just have them enter their height.
    Make them spread their legs a bit so we can get the leg length from the crotch.

    Segment & get measurements at various locations (waist, legs).
      But HOW do we get the waist measurements?
        It's different for a fat person than for a skinny one
      Maybe a fixed amt above the crotch (or that fixed amt but adjusted for height)
    We must take the very very best segmentation among all the rotated images in order to reliably use our crotch-finding method
 

  Business:
    Start with used jeans
    Local Craigslist (esp. good for little kids that constantly outgrow pants, also abnormally sized people like myself and the tall mTailor guy on YouTube)
    Jeans shrink in the wash
    "inseam" means pant-leg-rim to the crotch, NOT to the waist

  List of competitors:
    https://fashionista.com/2014/07/8-tech-startups-tackling-clothing-fit

















  Funds:
    Lookup UD classes' start date
      Tutor by sneaking around as usual
      Put in Zoho Cal




  Save locs where I was last working in "TODO:_new.txt"

  gad seg.py measure.py TODO.txt && gci "measure.py:   wrote 'find_leg_length(mask,height)'     seg.py: made sure segmentation output only includes the points we're pretty certain are in the body (np.greater(mask, certainty))" && gpus






    We're not gonna do SMPL if we just want measurements; it's silly
      So we'll make a database of clothing sizes, get the charts right, make a clothes search engine.  Other things, honestly, aren't practical

  Technical:
    Figure out how to scale the SMPL model to the right proportions exclusively from a smartphone picture
    Find the points of a SMPL model (or otherwise compute a similarity function between 2 bodies)
      hmr DOESN'T GET thinness / height / body measurements
      Mess with params of the model in render.py?
        "betas"
        m = load_model( '../../models/basicModel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl' )
        **** m.betas[:] = np.random.rand(m.betas.size) * .03 ****

      How to save .obj file from hmr dir?
























  Technical:
    Ensure mask is "contiguous" before using
    Take convHull of the mask?
      That's too extreme; only maybe a good idea locally
      The complete convHull would be convex; a convex polygon looks nothing like a human (Jesus pose)

  Business:
    Try to figure out how to get clothing meshes from Macy's, Kohl's, Wal-Mart, Gucci, Zara, 
      Hack 'em?
    Or maybe we can set up a remote attack so I can control their computers from home @ night
    Otherwise we can just use body-mesh similarity between 2 people to let them sell used clothing to each other
      We still would ideally prefer to show the user in the clothes, but by now that's probably impractical given our timeline and what I know about this process.
      Somehow we have to get the clothing from A to B though.
    It'll just be a shitty Craigslist-esque website.  That'll get us to ramen profitability.  Newmark is rich, but not THAT rich

  Ask Kendall how much time he has.  Tell him everything if you can afford to, but otherwise no good (ask for fundraising advice).

=======================================================================

    Dario meeting
      Cofounder of BadVR (CTO)
    1.  Car show (Dario mentioned )
      a.  Go where rich people hang out
      b.  But you have to be able to talk to them in a substantive way (this guy liked car)
      c.  Fewer features rather than more "add in version 2"
    2.  The guy talking at the car show said "sometimes more cash, less equity;" it depends what is needed right now
    3.  MVP (Minimum) is really important; only put the features you want feedback on
      a.  Meetup: ppl will try the product 4 u

  5 most common mistakes for entrepreneurs:
    1.  Offshore devs
      a.  Get lower amt in exit
      b.  Poor communication (translation)
    2.  Building a brand
      a.  Nobody cares about the brand until you have a product first
    3.  Trying to innovate
      a.  If you have no competition, you have no money
    4.  Thinking you are the customer
      a.  You need to get feedback
      b.  HTWFAIP (others' points of view)
    5.  Overvaluing the launch
      a.  Doesn't have to be perfect
      b.  Launch is just the 1st step

  Titles are useless in the 1st year
  Go to Hackathons to meet technical people
    1.  Say "I just want to present things; I'm good at public speaking"
      a.  Meet good engineers
    2.  builtinLA.com
  Trade shows

  VCs want to know you'll spend about HALF the money on marketing
  Organize everything with timelines
    "3 months all"
    Trello
    Split everything up and plan it all.
    Accountability is extremely important
      Deadlines are very motivating
        Should feel absolutely exhausted at the end of the day

  Marvelous Designs (clothing modeling software)
    Diff from 3ds Max
    Technically called "skinning" (Simone)
      Only an issue in extreme positions (ie. body fully stretched out)
      Prevention for bugs
      Every game does this
    See Simone's video about the process

  Maybe from 2 pictures of a hoodie takes only hours to build the clothing mesh

  Ask about Sansar:
    How good is it?
    It's something like ProdigyXAmazon.  VR version of "2nd life"
    "Social VR"
      ie. Runescape
    Try Sansar myself
    Cross-platform?
      Oculus-Internet possible?

  update progress on Zoho / Slack

=======================================================================

  1st make perfect (best possible) skin_nathan.npy
    Standardize alignment of the masks (ie. all to the belly button)
    Or weight the "downshift" of the masks by the length across of the widest mask (ie. if we have the full Jesus cross-section, take the length from fingertip to fingertip and that indicates we're looking at the person face-on)
      Whereas if the current length-across of the masks is small (side view), that means the CoM should be bumped up to match the CoM at the Jesus-view (front)
    Or at least CoM-adjustment for masking

    Maybe use the sin() of the angles of the length of the arms to determine the angle.  See how well it actually works, though.  Perhaps the simpler interpolation method is easier, but then we're assuming constant rotation speed
  Masking

  Debug:
    (cat_opencv3)  how come this rotates stuff off the "screen"?   I don't really understand why it has to get wiped out this way............'
    We have to do the rotation s.t. it initially expands the possible locs before cutting off any out-of-bounds voxels.  Perhaps the best way to do this is to do the rotation, remove those "external" points, then do all the rounding and "model[idxes]=True"-setting

    lookup hollow() or get_skin() in numpy/scipy/rawPython

  Idea:
    Rotate bunch of voxel coordinates using simple 3x3 rotation matrix, then make a 2x2x2 block around each of the new voxel locations and turn those 8 voxels "on" in the rotated np array.
      Here the limiting step is conversion btwn data forms.
      Wait, how did I fucking not think of this before?  It's so beautifully simple.
      Is this faster than the other way of going through space voxel by voxel, doing the inverse rotation, and then checking whether the voxel nearest the inverse rotated point is on?
        Potentially, because this way we're only dealing with the locs that are "on"
        I could dream up an optimization where we constantly keep a running "checklist" of the voxels that are "on" (in a hashtable) and remove things whenever the corresponding rotated pt is turned "off" by a masking.  This way we don't have to convert as much; just have to make sure we do the angle math right
        The reason this is faster is I can use ANY previously optimized matrix-processing code to do this rotation; it's just a single matrix multiplication.  Hrm...

      Also we need to have money for living then.  Otherwise I should find a way to raise some.
  Clarify dates with Dad.
    Don't be too rude or specific with this;
    Better to just be nice to him.  Learn from your experience with Jeannine.

  How to establish myself and make SOME money (money shouldn't be the emphasis over connections):
    Grad school:
      Columbia
        Ask Vishal for recommendation?
        Ask your profs
      UDel CS
      Transfer to Stanford if possible!!!
    Tech jobs:
      Remember, easiest to network my way in rather than do the blindly-spam-resumes shit
      Princeton Satellite Systems
      Tony
      Bloomberg (Kai-Zhan)
      PRH

      Google
      Facebook
      AirBnB, etc. (big companies)

  Code: 
    Test the covariance for conglomerated tetrahedra
    Plot/standardize evaluation of the "direction" of the normals so we can confirm that the algo actually does what it's supposed to.

    Ensure masking step actually works properly (automate for a single video)?
      Maybe easier to raise money if we don't have to do this?
      But it's probably best to be thorough before moving to the next part

  I decided to raise money instead of going for a job.  I think it's possible to "glue together" the pieces of the human being I want to make the 1st prototype of the app.

      Also allow the option "or we could deliberately NOT pick a leader"
      Argue for the CEO b/c otherwise things are too slow.

    Come up with papers (Sign NDA)
    Give Vishal some money for his contribution upon the valuation of the company at a certain dollar amount.
      Split evenly 4 ways
        Pierlorenzo Peruzzo, Nathan Bendich, Simone Zamparini, and Dario Gentiletti agree to each take 25% of the equity of the Virtual Clothing Mall company (name pending, not yet incorporated) evenly (25% each).  But this equity will be given to each of us a little bit each month, for 4 years after July 1st, 2019. on the 1st of each month.
        This contract will be void if and when any of these 3 happen.  All 4 founders must agree for any of these to take place:
          1.  Outside investment
          2.  Adding a new equity holder (ie. employee or founder)
          3.  Change of business entity type (according to [A], we should be a Delaware C-Corp)

        This contract was based on the informal agreement detailed in [B]
          [A] https://mashable.com/2016/01/27/startup-business-structure/#0FKCY7e7sGqh
          [B] https://www.docracy.com/35/founders-equity-agreementl
        Non-Disclosure Agreement: we (the four named above) agree to not disclose any details of the project to people outside the four founders after January 8th, 2019, unless for the purposes of fundraising, which must be agreed upon by all four founders.  If one of the four does so and the other three founders agree sharing the information hurt the company's interests, the other three may take away 1% of the total equity of the company from the one who said too much and split that 1% three ways (0.333% each)

        The 4 years was taken from the fact that Amazon took almost exactly 3 years from incorporation date to IPO.  I bet what we're doing is harder than what Amazon tried to do.  Regardless, 4 years is plenty of time to tell who's committed to it for the long run.

  Sunday no lines (reading Harry Potter (4?  5?))
  Monday thought through rotation some more; going to rotate in model.py instead of mesh.rkt
  Tuesday Oct 30: had work, but still wrote ~110 lines (see rotate_to_z_up.py)
  Wednesday Oct 31: 10 lines print_dict() in utils.py.  36 in rotate_to_z_up()
  Thursday Nov 1: thought up "rotate pts to find maxes, mins." This is easier than the method I thought of before that
    Felt guilty for running home to fap instead of working
  
  Friday Nov. 2: none.    50.5 lines/day on avg so far (303 total)
  Saturday Nov. 3: maybe like 50 lines in model.py and 17 lines in utils.py
  Did no code btwn Nov. 3rd and Nov 14th.  I finished Henry Ford's biography and met Dario Gentiletti.
    Wow that was a good bit of a dry spell.  Fuck I procrastin8 a lot lol
  Wednesday Nov. 14 16:46:35 EST 2018:  assessing whether rotation actually occurred in _model_rot8d_0_1_.txt.  It didn't, and I'm now investigating why not.
    Few lines of code written, but plenty of debugging is in the works.
  Thursday  Nov. 15: ~10 lines, but good debugging of how the rotation should ACTUALLY be
  Saturday  Nov. 17: ~20 lines, but good debugging of how the rotation should ACTUALLY be (fixed a bug that was making it stretch the A variable by 2 [sphere into reasonably extreme ellipsoid])
  Tuesday   Nov. 20: had a good chat with Dario and co. about what Einstein will become
  Wednesday Nov. 21: debugging rotation by hand

  The product I'd pay for is clothes that fit.  That's it.
    Not the 3-D viz unless it's REALLLY good
      So we'll just have to make it stinking good.

  Code:
    Run mesh.rkt on _model.txt
    Keep better track of bugs
      Use software like Fog Creek's???

    Go line-by-line in the algebra or code and figure out the problem with the sphere initialization
      Are all-small-values reasonable?  Will they work?
        At least the sphere is a simple unit test case
      Center the sphere for unit test
      PROBLEM??: penalizes too-large values of A,B,C,...J in dist_single_pt_heuristic()
        I'm not sure if this is actually wrong, though.  All that oughta matter is the RELATIVE value of A,B,C,...J to each other, right?
    Smart (human-body-tuned) kmeans initialization

    Surface fitting is not working atm.  Debug!
      Pick 3 pts >> plane
      We can solve for the plane of least variance
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15959411/fit-points-to-a-plane-algorithms-how-to-iterpret-results

  The product I'd pay for is clothes that fit.  That's it.
    Not the 3-D viz unless it's REALLLY good

  Code:
    Run mesh.rkt on _model.txt

    Go line-by-line in the algebra or code and figure out the problem with the sphere initialization
      Are all-small-values reasonable?  Will they work?
        At least the sphere is a simple unit test case
      Center the sphere for unit test
    Smart (human-body-tuned) kmeans initialization

    Surface fitting is not working atm.  Debug!
      Pick 3 pts >> plane
      We can solve for the plane of least variance

the fear of looking bad than by the hope of getting millions
of dollars. So if you want to get millions of dollars, put
yourself in a position where failure will be public and
humiliating.

    kmeans, triangular meshing
    


    Our reduction algorithm ought to take 4 pts which are close Manhattan-distance-wise and are not interrupted by any distant points and turn them into 3 points.  Whenever it successfully does so, it will reduce the number of faces by 3 (imagine a tetrahedron and then a single triangular planar face of that tetrahedron; that's the level of compression we can get.
    It should be initailized by kmeans (each mean will determine the points that should be looked through in finding the 4th point to remove).

    After we use this (4 -----> 3) reduction algorithm, we will probably want to use a neural network to fit a manifold to the remaining skin points.  Hopeuflly we won't have to train this neural net on extant skin model data, or if we DO have to use Michael J. Black's materials, we can get his (IP) Intellecual Property with permission or little risk of legal consequence.
        We may (I hope we don't have to, but we may) need to rewrite a graphics library entirely for this particular problem, just to prove to lawyers that we didn't steal anyone's VR IP.  It's possible we could grab some good shit from Unity, Oculus, or someone else, but most likely that will not solve the precise problem I'm trying to solve.  Perhaps the (manifolds --> Unity) problem is a doable one, and then that will be the problem I need to solve rather than rewriting all the graphics libraries myself.

    Should we shine speckled lights on a person's body,
        ("active illumination" as CV professionals call it),
        The depth of a point is proportional to the radius (area?) of the circle
        The angle of the plane tangential to the skin at that point is proportional to 
            A) the eccentricity of the ellipse and 
            B) the direction in which that ellipse points

        Then we ought to stitch together the various planes somehow.
        The method is similar to the approximation a la derivative as done by Euler?  Gauss?
            ie. where you do f(x+del) = f(x) + del f'(x)
        We can mathematize (formalize) this later and make an algorithm of it.

Also, if people talk to each other and like each other and value each other as people, they're probably more likely to put in the extra mile than for a total stranger.

    Hang the bluescreen (tape it at some height)
    Take pictures in front of it
    See how well they segment




    First week:
        Exploration
    2nd week:
        Take good photographs
    3rd week:
        Segmentation
    4th week:
        Extract pants size from segmented images
    5th week:
        Scrape web for pants
    6th week:
        UI (suggest the pants to the user)

Nathan's action plan example:
    1.  Submit photos
    2.  
    3.  
    4.  
    5.  
    6.  
    7.  
    8.  
    9.  Nathan's only concerns are whether we can make the clothing fit realistically without IP from someone like Michael Black.  So he suggests we just take pictures of the person, see whether we have any clothing that fits peoiple similarly shaped to that user, and recommend that clothing if we have it.  Then, if they buy, we make royalties.
        The user will see suggested clothing and a guarantee that that clothing will fit them.  They will also be able to pick their favorite colors, pattern they like, and style of clothing (ie. jeans vs. slacks).  I like the idea of icons and buttons rather than just a search bar, but if they want to type in a specific color/style we haven't shown with buttons, there should be a search bar as well.  It's an app, not a physical booth.  The booth is part of the picture-acquiring and segmentation process used to help size the user so we can recommend clothing that fits and will flatter their body type.  So they will open an app that looks something like Amazon and be able to purchase things in a familiar way, but they have to know the clothes will fit when they arrive.
        "Buy" and "next" buttons.
        I was thinking the only source of revenue would be comissions on the sold clothing.


Vishal's action plan example:
    1.  Submit photos
    2.  
    3.  
    4.  
    5.  
    6.  
    7.  
    8.  
    9.  Open the app. Load a set of recommended clothes. See if they fit. Buy them, earn royalty. And display "recommendations", not "ads" in the surrounding mall 

    Clarifying questions:
        Are the recommended clothes displayed on the user's body?
        Do they come from nearby stores?  Neighbors?  Distant sellers?
        How closely do they need to fit?

    Nathan's thoughts:
        When someone buys a $10 shirt, Nathan and Vishal make $0.30 (this is what Vishal means by "royalty")
        This is what I mean by "commission" (royalties)
_____________________________

    Planning out "is this venture going to be profitable and how?" is , in my opinion, not the best use of our time, because it's hard to predict the future.  So if people talk too much about vision and predicting the fturure rather than starting the actual (technincal) work, that irritates me a bit because it feels like I'm wasting my time.
    I also know that Elon Musk doesn't write business plans anymore for precisely this reason.  And even if we are nothing like Elon Musk, we can still learn from this part of his action because he has started more businesses than us and has succeeded more than most people ever succeed.

    3.  Build 3-D model from masks

        b.  Can we get each pixel on each mask to map to a single point in Blender?
            1)  Then moreover, we'll need to describe the almost-infinitely-many faces that make up the topology of a human body
        c.  
    4.  Color 3-D model
    5.  Segment out clothing
    6.  Put on new clothing

============================================================================
Cat pipeline:
    1.  Take pictures
        a.  How do we get uniform speed on the Lazy Susan?
============================================================================
        For next few days, we're focused on segmentation.  Let's hang the bluescreen and take pics
        Red light?  Green light?
        Account for the natural slowdown of the Lazy Susan due to coeff of friction mu and account for that in the rotation speed W (omega).  This way we can accurately acquire the 90 degree, 180 degree, 45 degree, etc. pictures.
============================================================================
    2.  Segment pictures
        a.  Blue-screen
        b.  GIMP
============================================================================
    3.  Get measurements
        a.  Waist
        b.  Inseam (height to waist)
    4.  Scrape web for pants that fit that size
        a.  Helps to have a tailor on our payroll / as a cofounder
    5.  Offer pants


============================================================================
Ideas for how to get measurements:
============================================================================
    3.  Ask for jeans measurements of similarly shaped people.  Then we have to measure similarity somehow (either by 3-D models or height or somethin else)
        a.  We'll have to go to a tailor for this, but it can definitely be done.
        b.  We also need a significant datastore of people and their measurements.  But this can be done in time once we have a tailor on board our staff.
============================================================================

    1.  Haar cascades to belly button (or other notable feature)
        a.  Even for this, we have a problem b/c not everyone's belly button is at the same height relative to their inseam.
        b.  This also relies on us being able to see the belly buttons.
    4.  Include height of known object in the picture next to person's leg/general body part

    Have people compete over selling you the thing
    You can place a bounty on an item if you literally need it in 10 minutes before you go to work
    Borrowing that item is also allowed
    Hrm, this only really works for stuff like suits, right?
    But that could still be a viable business model: being a suits marketplace and lending-facility

    The VR comes later
    Rather than writing up some huge analytical argument, just post the friggin' ad and see whether people in our own f***ing community will give us their stuff

The beginning of what could become a revolution:
    "Hi, we're getting rid of your old stuff for you!  If you're moving out and have anything you can't sell, we'll give you a nickel for each item.  We live in unit 376: Nathan Bendich and Vishal Anand."
    Other logistics:
        1.  If you have to move out within the day and we're not currently there, you can leave your stuff and send an e-mail to nxbendich@yahoo.com with your venmo username and you'll get your money by the end of tomorrow.
        2.  If you need something and don't want to A) wait for it to ship or B) pay for shipping, contact nxbendich@yahoo.com for inquiries.  We predict we'll get quite a few of the following: mattresses, sheets, and pillows.

        I still need jeans, but we have to be a marketplace.
            I need jeans fast.  I need jeans tomorrow.  I need jeans next door.
            We store user data (2-3 things they need recurringly and can't find anywhere else).
            It's like AirBnB meets Amazon meets StackOverflow.  YOu can sell it out of your house, you get rating, and you GET NOTIFIED AS SOON AS SOMEONE POSTS WHAT YOU WANT.
            It has to fit around your life.  It has to not waste your time (be better than FB Marketplace or craigslist).  It has to be scam-free (SOverflow-style no-spammers reputation to prevent the Craigslist problem)
            Basically, it just formalizes neighbor-neighbor transactions and makes it easier for you to get whatever you need.  There are thousands of these apps out there, but for some reason none of them quite has dominance?  I guess Amazon does, kinda, but it's not fast enough and return-to-sender is too hard.
            We acquire and exchange rare items:
                MTG cards
                Old porn
                Weirdly-shaped bodies (lanky and tall like me)
                Obscure sports apparel
                Weird books

                Old video games
                Lessons on Google Fiber
            Limited time only!  Sales
                This way people only have to hold shit for like 2 weeks (1 week?) and also it'll sell faster.
            Should be tailored to people who are moving out so they have hella shit to dump.
            We can also fish around trash cans in the beginning.  Free stuff is where our margin comes in.
            We can go super duper old school and rather than selling an app, we can just have the thing buzz a tiny radio antenna in your pocket
            One radio antenna should be for general "there's a new thing at the local store" announcement and the other should be for "there's something very similar to what you've bought before" announcement.  Because there are always stupid ppl like Janie in the world who like to buy stupid cheap shit and we should make a tiny bit of money everytime that happens.

        We have to be so bloody easy to figure out that oldsters and youngsters can both use us equally easily.

    Calculations for "rolling resistance" (the reason the ball bearings might slow down at all) acquired from the following physics website:
https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/rolling-resistance.html

    An easier solution, considering we don't have perfectly round, oiled ball-bearings, is to programmatically calculate when the thickness of the mask is minimal and maximal (maximal at points forward or backwards, minimal at points where the body is facing right or left).
        Then we could calculate 45 degree, 30 deg, 60 deg angles with a fair amt of certainty

    1.  Initialize an SMPL model from 1st pic (establish a "1st pic": ideally one where we can see all the limbs and we have data for a SMPL model in that pose)
    2.  Do something like SGD on model; use each new picture @ a diff angle to update the model's thickness parameters.  If we were to re-do SMPL, we'd want to be able to tune every tiny detail.  But that's very much a long-term (not at all MVP) kind of problem.
    3.  Minimize MSE (or other Objective Function) of (curr_model - segmentation of curr_theta_view)
        a.  This requires a constant (highly precise) angular velocity applied to the turntable.
    4.  Tweak each radius on the body individually

    For demo:
        1)  Person (Jen Aniston) walks around with old clothes on,
        2)  Then with no clothes,
        3)  Then with new clothes

    .pkl files are the SMPL representations.  I'm still not 100% sure whether they're in .npy format, but also idk how much that matters
_____________________________

    For final:
        Simulate every particle in the entire human body (organs included?) for highest fidelity.
            Idk how much memory dedicate purely to the physics is required for this

    1)  Segment and model legs
        a)  Use pose estimation & Tubingen datasets
        EDIT: As of Fri, Jun  8 (14:13:40 PDT 2018), my understanding is that SMPL AND DMPL (SMPL + soft tissue deformations) are our best bet for realistic movement, body deformations, etc.  These models can be derived froma  single image with some level of fidelity, and (perhaps most importantly) they are easily rotatible, resizable, deformable, and portable to various platforms (Unity, etc.)
        As for getting a SMPL model out of a single image, see https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr.  

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

            SMPL:  (presumably Michael J. Black talking)
            The parameters of the model are learned from data including the rest pose template, blend weights, pose-dependent blend shapes, identity-dependent blend shapes, and a regressor from vertices to joint locations.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________






Question: How is DMPL different from Dyna?
    Both do soft-tissue
    My best guess rn is that Dyna is triangle-based (it only tracks the skin)
    Therefore, it's not compatible with Unity3D, Maya, Blender, UnrealEngine, etc.

    Is DMPL open-source just like SMPL?
    The way SMPL works is by tracking a few key points on the human body (joints) and extrapolating the skin from these points via "weights" on these various body regions.  So the first step is probably to get SMPL running on Unity or Blender for the demo (MVP).

    1)  Segment and model legs
    2)  start scraping the internet for sizing data & figure out 
Hire Michael Black (no, just see what code you can grab)
    How do we build the legs?
        Triangles in the mesh
        Is that better than the particle/voxel model I'm using now?  Hrm...
        Perhaps everything could just come out of that 3-D modeling dataset.  Idk whether we have commercial rights to such data, but oh well

    Michael Black Notes
_____________________________

    Kinect extracts depth, whereas standard camera does not do active lighting of the scene.
    SMPL is "skinning model" instead of triangle based, whatever the fuck THAT means.  Perhaps quadrilaterals?  Perhaps
        Anyway, the answer to the question "what is a skinning model?" lies in the SMPL / DMPL paper.  DMPL is SMPL that takes into account bouncy fat ("soft tissue" as opposed to skeletons, which are estimated with "pose estimation" algorithms)

Laundry (dry it out)

==========================================================================
Code { // begin "Code" TODO segment
    Automate segmentation (3-D Graph Cut AKA Video Cut)
    Do we do end-to-end integration?
        If so, how?
            1.  Assume everyone will be on the bluescreen for simplicity's sake.  Probably best for the MVP anyway.
                a.  Do we deal with smoothing edges?  Is this even important for model generation?  (No; don't do this rn)
                b.  So basically we're delaying on the segmentation bit.  We need to get a webpage up with a Unity model for a proper demo.
==========================================================================
            2.  Try to deal with segmentation in its total complexity and program a Neural Net today (clearly Vishal knows more about NN shit anyway).  As far as implementing Video Cut goes, I'm sure there are poor Ph.Ds we can hire to do that shit

==========================================================================
==========================================================================

    Other thoughts:

    We shouldn't launch on mobile.  We should launch on CPU.  Neither Vishal nor I is a JS / Swift / Droid master, and we want an MVP
        I guess even just launching on web will involve some JS, but I know Flask (kind of) and Vishal understands Unity so he can get Unity launched in-Browser

    "Vector" as June mentioned; should be scalable representation

    Unreal Engine make slightly idealized avatar of a person instead of using their 100% likeness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9msqaoJZw, 3:30)
    http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/30129/1/02.pdf

    Segmentation should be done w/ multiple methods and "and"ed together.  We can also "fill in" like one would in MS Paint so little "background" "holes" in the body go away, as do "foreground" sections in the actual background.

} // end "Code" TODO segment
==========================================================================

UnrealEngine4 "backwards compatilibility": Can I view a site that uses Unreal Engine4 on a very old laptop and still see in high definition?

# Backwards compatible?

### The project:

I want to render a high definition model on my personal website such that it'll be rendered in the highest definition possible on any device, from a 20-year-old Gateway PC running Windows 95 to an iPhoneX. It's particularly important that it's real pretty on mobile (whatever Android and iPhone models are big these days)

### The question: 
I was thinking I'd buy an expensive desktop with GPUs to make sure I can make the app really fancy for users on a high-end desktop with nice monitors. But I'm not going to do that if a mobile user won't be able to see anything the high-definition I get on my new expensive screen doesn't make it out to the app my employer is building. How does this work? Does OpenGL display the highest-definition render it can on the mobile device?

=======================================================
        A great comment on a School of Life video:
=======================================================
1. Here is the joke love the most about self deception: 

" So there is this guy who suspects that his wife cheats on him. He hires a private detective to find out what's going on. After one week of a business trip he comes back and asks to the detective: 

- So what have you seen?

 - Sir, the first day when you were gone, your wife met this very handsome young man. And then they went to a fancy restaurant. After that they went to see a movie. After the movie, late at night, they went to your place , right to your bedroom. Then they hugged each other for quite a while. 

- And then ?? What happened then?

- Then your wife closed the curtains...

So the husband says:

 - God damn it! You pay a fortune to a private detective to find out the truth and even then, you can't be absolutely sure!! "

Well, the sad thing about this joke is that we are all like this poor guy to a certain extent... We do  what he does on several issues about ourselves, but don't even notice it!  


In this case it can be very valuable to pay attention to what the people who warn us, are saying. Other people may know certain things about you, much better than you!

Because as the very wise proverb goes: 

" You can't read the label from inside the jar". 

2. Two movies that really touched me deeply on this subject are: 

Sunset Boulevard by Billy Wilder
Flight by Robert Zemeckis  ( Denzel Washington is amazing in this movie! )

Of course I won't say what's the end of which one but here is the thing:

You must watch both of them. Because one will show you what will happen to you in the end,  if you keep lying to yourself all your life.  And the other will encourage you  to face the bitter truths about yourself by showing you that no matter how late it may be and how painful, ultimately it will be good for you!  


3. I am totally addicted to the oldest psychology podcast on this planet: " Shrink Rap Radio". There you have a 75 year old shrink, Dr. Dave,  who always interviews another shrink. He is a very wise and very funny man. The best mixture! You can listen to an episode called: 

 " The Lies We Tell Ourselves" with Jon Frederickson.

The man has a book called " The Lies We Tell Ourselves. How To Face  the Truth, Accept Yourself and Create a Better Life".

4. One book we all must read is " The Death of Ivan Ilyich"by Tolstoy. Especially the 9th chapter  is  unforgettable .It shows you in great detail what will happen to you in your death bed if you had an " unexamined" life. Probably the most scary but most important book I have ever read. 

5. Here is a quote by Primo Levi I will never forget. He was a great writer who survived the Holocaust. He said:

 “Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.”

Well, if you think about it, all those " common men" who ended up being monsters had one thing in common:  their capacity for self delusion. 

It can happen to any of us, that's why we must always be very vigilant, looking always deeply into our actions and motivations. 

6. I always find it really hard, but I am sure that thinking a lot is a very good thing. Only if we can do it properly though. And self deceptions can be cured, especially if an " early diagnosis" is possible. The best tool I know for these purposes is Alain de Botton's "Philosophical Meditation". They have a video about it on this channel.

If you want to give it a try, you should click on the link under that video and print the questions you'll have to ask yourself. In my humble opinion it is the most effective and direct way to your inner world. You just sit down wit a pen and paper and try to answer those questions honestly. And then you know how you REALLY feel.

If you do it often enough, eventually you look forward to it. It is like a meeting with someone you so much wanted to understand: yourself. 

But in the first days, you always feel a certain inner- resistance to it. It is like going to the dentist! You know some things will hurt. I mean some of those questions, when you answer them honestly, cause you more pain in that moment, than if you had ignored them instead.

But it really is always an eye opening experience. It is like a soul cleaning. 

I always repeat this point,  because I can't recommend it enough!

Thank you for this very valuable lesson and for the excellent animation!﻿

1)  copy Jae's .bashrc (the part where he compresses the prompt into something much smaller) into my .bashrc 
2)  ask Amit how to make ARGON.0.1.jar   DONE
   a)  follow up:  is it online?
4)  do we have to download vcftools?     DONE
   a)  what is vcf?
3)  learn to exclude files in grep / regex / blobs
   a) UNIX power tools book?


4)
Submit YC app?  (get this done the day after meeting Pe'er.  It's also possible we could use more feedback and time to interview possible cofounders  before submitting.  Perfecting the idea is probably more important than interviewing cofounders because that can be done simultaneously; we'll get on Kendall, Alan, Kundan, Kai-Zhan, Luke, Ben Hanser, Kevin Chen, John, whoever else)

This should come second; don't worry too much about this until we have solved concern #1.

Only the Paranoid Survive, (by Andy Grove) page 32




Fri Jan 11 18:22:13 EST 2019
  Applied to a lyft job I'll probably never hear back from.  Mostly submitted my resume online just so I could feel like I'd done SOMETHING today, rather than nothing but thinking.
  I now think getting a job at a startup (ideally a VR startup) will help me in life in multiple ways, first at least in giving me a salary and then also it will give me a shot at getting to know some VCs, meet people who have connections, who have more experience writing software, etc.

  Then locate waist from openpose?  Wait, this all shouldn't be necessary.  I'm probably running away again.
