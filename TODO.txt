  Text Joe Evans about accountant.

  Job app:
    https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/jobs/phd
  Ask MJB/Melanie Feldhofer which of the requirements is most considered at MPI?
    It'll PROBABLY be similar to what Prof. Harchol is talking about.

  Figure out logistics of applying for Ph.D with MJB.
    Probably trying through a different grad school is a better option.

  We can also intern for MJB after becoming a grad student.  No.  First, let's go at it (try) directly.       It's probably best to just go for what I really want, directly.

    In "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf"
      The Ph.D. application has several parts:
        i. Transcript – Grades and classes                                              BAD
        ii. GRE scores & TOEFL scores                                                   DECENT
        iii. Personal Statement                                                         COULD MAKE GOOD EASILY ENOUGH
        iv. Previous research experience (possibly in industry).                        SOME
        v. Recommendation letters                                                       BAD
        vi. Awards and extracurricular activities                                       BAD

    Tubingen will have different standards than a shittier Ph.D program (ie. UD, UPenn, UT, maybe even UW?)






































































  This once again opens up the question "should I even continue with this particular idea?"
    Yes.
    No matter where I go, I COULD end up finding a real need that gives me money.  So therefore, it's best to still go with Black & this idea.

  Do you think using Kelsey's referral is worth anything?
    Just tell Mary/whoever the Kelsey thing IFF we pass the 1st round phone-screen.
    / use Kelsey's referral to apply again after the whole thing has blown over
    It's literally amazing how little Calvin's referral was actually worth. (ie. anyone I know who works @ Goog prob/possibly could have gotten me in just like Calvin's bro)











  "It's so exciting to hear Google is planning to build Waymo cars in Detroit.  It seems like the need to stay on top of innovation is really important here.  Can you tell me more about how this value plays out in other sectors of Google?"

  "The scale of impact someone can make at a company like Google is like none other.  You can touch lives all across the world with even a small innovation"

  Concise, focused answers




  2.  What's a day in your life at Google? 
    Have you been an SRE?  Tech Lead?
    Where did you work before and what's the difference?
  1.  Ask about keeping in touch about future roles

  SREs needs to know distributed systems
    Kelsey
    What's the objective of the architecture
  BORG and Chubby
  GFS (Google file system)     (replaced by Colossus and BigTable)
  BigTable whitepaper


  Deliberate practice in the shared Google Doc (~40 minutes timer)

  Look @ the way I asked Eliana for input, and ask Kelsey the same way.
    But can she legally help you game the interview?


  Distributed hash tables
  Onboarding process (the main guy leads SRE-EDU)


  Google
    Anyone can transfer away at any time for any reason
    Makes people think about the long term rather than short-term gain
  Google sounds like a good place to work

  Schedule a talk about engineers.
    Fewer SREs than devs
      Scarce resource
      SREs do PROD stuff
      Performance, reliability. scalability (SREs)
    Try to be methodical

  SRE != devOps
    "Automating ourselves out of a job"
    (Not on call all night like Dana Schwartz was at Intel)
    "Automating ourselves out of a job"
    Don't be a hero; be smart, be sustainable, etc.
    More control of the process ()
      Workers have agency, control


  I get to write new code! 
    Brag to interviewer about this.
    Ask the interviewer(s) "are you an SRE?"
    We get to own a whole project ourselves, direct it, etc.  Ask a Googler whether this is standard in the first few months, or does it take a year or so to get this much agency?


  Because Google has enough money to invest in the long term, there's time to step back & change the system s.t. it's better off in the long term.  This was not true at ISPs (ie. AT&T ?) in Des' experience as a Google advertising SRE.

  Glassdoor (is this a good fit for your company's culture?)

  Interpreted vs. compiled language?
    What's the difference?

  Python-specific questions?

  One of the interviews is SRE specific
    2 of these Google SRE book ()
    For this interview, look up "Production engineer" questions.

 -1.  Job description keywords
  0.  What's the day-to-day like at Google?
    a.  Distributed system
    b.  More communication in SRE   than in SWE
      1)  More team-based
      SWE more deep than SRE
  1.  If there was something you could change about your job, what would it be?
    a.  

  2.  What differentiates people who are excellent at this role from people who are only average?
    a.  Reading breadth of documents and piecing together architecture
      Colossus
      Distributed file systen
      Integrated among teams among the lower part of the stack
    Communication more important
    Broad

    You DO get to work on a project
    Max 30% "toil" work
      Learn from tickets
      be on call (pager)

  3.  What was one thing you wish you'd known when you started this role?
    a.  Kelsey's team is really old   &   it's hard to learn this all on the fly

  4.  Why do you use this tech stack?
  5.  What is the career path for people like you?
    a.  6-15 ppl/SRE team
      1 Tech lead
        easier to go SRE->TL
      1 Manager
        Probably a liberal arts major

    b.  Hierarchy: How many teams are you leading & interacting with?
    c.  Start @ level 3
    d.  Promoted to lvl 4 if you're good
    e.  L5  (your team + one other team)
    f.  L6  (organization level in office)
    g.  L7  (all of GCloud)
    h.
    i.  Peers for feedback
    j.
    k.

  6.  What did you wish you had done differently to prepare for your Google interview?
    a.  1 Google interview
    b.  FB Production interview
      1)  Explain BiOS
      2)  Kelse blew this one lol




  7.  Mirror what they're asking
  8.  Gauge what Google is looking for as you chat with the interviewers
  9.  Learn about the company (try to act cool, more like you don't care than too overeager)
  10. Smile over the phone
  11. Be funny
  12. Sound interested (recent Google current events in the news)
  13. Mike same 20 questions throughout the interviews (not true for devs & Google)
    Fizzbuzz questions
  14. Ask about keeping in touch about future roles
    a.  Politeness
  15. Later roles
  16.
  17. Story about leadership
    a.
  18. 20-30 lines code
  19.
  20.
  21. Ask 3-5 questions after the interview (don't seem dumb)

  Give off the impression "works well with others"

  Keep printed notes in front of you (no Googling)

    I still need to figure out a CUDA 8   install.
    Kill hmr5 instance if it's not needed.

    Expand sda1 again (resize2fs, growpart)
    The 25 MPII video batches may also need to be downloaded (http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/#download)
      BUT, on my personal laptop, when I generated the tfrecords, I'm like 90% sure we didn't have to have the batches to continue.
        This may be wishful thinking, but I'm just super duper hoping I don't have to do too much more work to get the thing going.  Although I somehow still need to not f*ck up the Sminchisescu H3.6M dataset acquisition.  Hm... we COULD say we're a startup that is as-of-yet unfunded?
          I could also ask Ramberg again.

    E-mail his secretary instead?
      What do I write?  (I would like access to this dataset and Professor Sminchisescu hasn't replied in x days?)
      Give it tiiiiiiiiiiiiime


  Should I talk to H3.6 as if we're a company?  (Ask the guys)
      It's probably best to be as upfront as possible.  Lying outright is definitely bad, and even concealing the truth is probably not advisable.  If they've been contacted by startups before, they'll be used to us not having money outright.
    When should I e-mail them?
    https://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/checkregister.php.
    The last time I tried to lie it failed.  So probably worth considering telling the truth.  But by now, I've already pretended I'm associated with Shree Nayar.  So I guess it's too late...  Here's hoping they just give me access without questioning it.
      I wonder how much time they ACTUALLY put into monitoring who uses H3.6 ...  It might be much less than you'd think.  We'll just see, right?  Maybe we can get the data out of someone else (ie. his "administrative assistant," one of the other authors, etc.)

  Follow directions.  Finish training HMR.  Then win.
    "TFRecord Generation" #3 in https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr/blob/master/doc/train.md.

  Can we test HMR changes without downloading all the training data & setting it up?  I think mostly it's just better to download everything, documents the steps (gcloud ..., )
    If we can see the body in real time via tensorboard, we know whether our changes are improving the training.  Therefore, we should DOWNLOAD THE TRAINING DATA 1st, EVEN THOUGH we DON'T HAVE a GPU

  TensorFlow: figure out how to put the constant inputs to pose params in tf.
    a.  src/trainer.py
      1.  There's an initial input to "state" that we need to change in "src/trainer.py," and maybe ALSO one in src/RunModel.py.
      2.  There's an iterative input to "state" that happens within the for loop.
        a)  I think the 3D_module shouldn't spit out new pose parameters.  But should it take IN the 72 pose params?
      3.  retrain HMR?  (look 4 directions 2 do this the right way)
    b.  L8r, do src/RunModel.py.
    c.  Write the pose params into the 2-D-projection module.
    d.  They also need to go into the SMPL function M(theta, beta) (this func is illustrated in the HMR paper's diagram)        b4 they go into the discriminator D that checks whether the mesh is a realistic human or a monster.





      1.  Maybe doesn't exist in here (we're just RUNNING the model, after all)




















  Ask dad for shekels?  Maybe go over to Switzerland and ask him in person.  Or ask gramma.  It's better than the intellectual slavery we have at Results Tutoring & even with Dario.
    Sleep on the floor in Butler
      Somehow we'd want to hide a sleeping bag/bed somewhere and take it out only after all the security guards left.
        Find a thrown-out mattress somewhere in Manhattan to do this
      Or sleeping bag in Butler stacks
      Or a sleeping bag in some less-checked Columbia library.
    The much much better version of this plan is to renovate a Manhattan dumpster like that guy "Gregory Kloehn" did.

    Copy images and render.pngs to the right directories.
    Read 3D_MuVS.pdf and SMPLify.pdf so we understand why the HEVA model had to move and make a video of multiple frames.
    MuVS almost certainly HAS to work on 3 camera views of literally the same frame.  That's how the HEVA dataset is, at least.  If this is true, we have to use a different model (ie. set of assumptions about the images we took of the customer) for our purposes.
      I can always try it and see whether the fit is better than HMR?  Or perhaps I overreacted w.r.t HMR & we can just use that.  It's a tad unclear...  But I'm like 70% sure that we need to get the side view.  Perhaps multi-view HMR with slight replacements?  Or multi-view SMPLify.  Either way, we can't help but eventually figure out how

  Dario:
    We can always deliver HMR now so investors can see something to invest in, then I can fill in the details later once we have a little more money.

  Similar to HMR with thorough masks & uses "mask diff SMPL deeplab" as a loss function.
    Also must do this at the 90 degree angle view from the front view (ie. side view).



  HMR openpose keypoints vs. SMPL skeleton projections (reprojection loss in HMR paper)
    This is how we can reshape the SMPL mesh (thru betas) to be the right size.
    We can feed the pose in as a fixed quantity (ie. T-pose)
  This is _basically_ BNN
 
  Crop & openpose_keypts.json.
    It preprocesses & reshape the images to (1,224,224,3)  (224x224 pixels)
      But also, the real image (the fraction the person inside) doesn't take up the whole 224x224.

    1st, just reformat our openpose 1.2 format into openpose 1.0 & add forehead/top-of-head/whatever it's called.

   Pseudocode:
    if config.has_key('json_path'):  joints=config['json_path'],  (instead of tf predict())
    parse_keypts file,   add forehead (guesstimate it as above eyes, nose, in middle of face, etc.):
      eyes_x=np.mean(r_eye{X], l_eye[X])
      eyes_y=np.mean(r_eye{Y], l_eye[Y])    # technically these aren't the "eyes;" they're the bridge of the nose.
      calced_forehead= (     eyes_x,  eyes_y - abs(eyes_y-nose[Y]) )
      ****************** finesse these points into the right shape, scale, etc.  ******************

   pltshow(skel_img)   on the image "random.jpg" ?







  Can we "improve" just the pose estimation by "swapping" openpose in there instead?
    Then I don't even know whether this is something we SHOULD be doing.  Don't we get to fix the pose (ie. tell the customer how to stand and where to put their arms, etc.)?  In which case really all we should be doing is learning the betas (shape, not pose).
    Supposing it's as simple as "replacing the 2-D pose keypoints," we automatically get the flexibility to either  A) use openpose or  B) manually set the pose parameters theta and only fiddle with the betas.





  But we NEED SMPL.  It is maintained; I bet it has many features that other bodies of work don't, such as the smoothly-bending joints.
    Record the HMR paper so you can listen to it  on the walk to work,  on the walk back, etc.

  Somewhat similar to VHMR (shape from 360 degree video):
    Balan et al.  CVPR '07
    Jain  et al.  SIGGRAPH '10
    Rhodin et al. ECCV '16

  But they're no good  A) without publicly available code and  B) if they don't produce SMPL (SMPL is maintained, addresses the shortcomings of previous work, etc.)
    Also, HMR ===> VHMR is MUCH MUCH easier than the backwards operation (technique that requires video => technique that only requires a single image)


















































  Today, just figure out where the ***king betas are.  Read through her code, and find them.
  IF you get through that, then you can worry about the rest of it (reviewing the mesh_err() code, etc.)
  check https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr/issues/79

  Look up Procrustes problem.

  Dario thinks we want to just evaluate HMR's accuracy on as many people as possible.   Would probably actually be a good idea; should I just go up to strangers and ask to measure them?  Maybe I could sell it well enough, hehehehehuehuehue.



  1.  TODO:
    mesh_chest()
    mesh_waist()
    mesh_inseam()
    mesh_hips()       # the hips that are good for the clothing measurements

    A lot of these are easier to achieve through HMR (SMPL skeleton).

  get normalize_mesh() working in a smart way.

  Integrating end-to-end new_betas=>new_mesh function:
    Figure out all the packages I need & what versions, both to visualize the new SMPL mesh & to debug it.
    conda cv2
    conda opendr?   (But only if we need it to go betas=>mesh)




  We might have to write_smpl() with HMR's SMPL() class instead.
    chumpy itself was just loaded from a pickle, and I'm not 100% sure whether it auto-differentiates all the way to the vertices.
      basicModel_m_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl
      basicModel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl

  debug smpl.py's function write_smpl().
    Does chumpy work by itself, or do I need to deal with the opendr sh!t to get the obj mesh to update with the betas?
  AFAIK, write_smpl() must rewrite the obj fname in blender_import_obj.py in order to change which mesh we import in blender.  It can't take sys.argv from within a subprocess.call([]).

  Blender should be callable within smpl.py

  We're using cat11; I installed cython version 0.26 on it.   chumpy on it
    If there are any package-versioning problems, they will rear their ugly heads later.


  To continue coding, we first have to get EVERYTHING working end-to-end in a single python3 (conda) environment.
    Search through EVERY comment in all Loper's files til we find out whether he compiled:
      #include <GL/OpenGL.h>             
        and
      #include <GL/CGLTypes.h>
    himself, or whether they're from the official libraries.

    TODO: test cython 0.26 in cat11

      a.
    2.  "debug ctx_mesa.c into existence" from ctx_mac_internal.c (/home/n/Documents/code/opendr_github/opendr/opendr/contexts/ctx_mac_internal.c) (change whatever we need to from Matt Loper's Mac OS X Darwin to our Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xereus)

      c.  Use blender as your graphical debugger INSTEAD OF openDR.
      d.  Ask the prof Rasmussen / his TA for help {ie. which library it is on Ubuntu.} (perhaps they won't know either, but maybe it's worth a shot)
      e.  brute force through each possible library, one at a time (automate it?)
      f.  find which .so files the sudo apt-get install [libGL shit in here] refers to, so we can tell what we need to do.
      
      g.  grep through smpl code to see WHERE OPENDR IS ACTUALLY REFERENCED.
        b/c if it's referenced in anything critical, we MUST get it working.  I think it's extremely unlikely it's part of chumpy/SMPL itself

    3.  test opendr in cat12, cat11, etc.
    4.  cv2 versions,
    5.

    Various requirements.txt / setup.sh  files

    Build PROPER ctx_mesa.so to put in /home/n/x/p/fresh____as_of_Dec_12_2018/vr_mall____fresh___Dec_12_2018/conda_+/lib/python3.6/site-packages/opendr/contexts/ so we can get opendr working.

    Get all the opendr to python3 somehow, fixed chumpy, etc.
    Absolute import via PYTHONPATH enwironment wariable.







    cat11.





      TODOS:
        ctx_mesa.so to python3.

        1.  chumpy to python3. (2to3)  add to PYTHONPATH, etc.
          a.  Once we have chumpy working 100% and cv2 versions reconciled, we can try to get opendr working.
          Seems to be working.  Haven't tested, but imports properly at least.

        opendr actually isn't anything but opencv (cv2) under the hood.  So it's prob just chumpy we have to migrate to python3, if any.
        2.  chumpy to python3?  (2to3)
        2.5.  configure properly.  (PYTHONPATH?)
        3.  reconcile opencv versions.  (prob move to the new one)

        1.  opendr to python3   (2to3)
        1.5.  configure properly.  (PYTHONPATH?)
        4.
        5.  Whatever else we come across.  "last was doing" notes are helpful, as is "next to do," but trying to plan everything out all at once inevitably leads to you missing things & making wrong assumptions.
        6.
        7.  MORE: hunt down every last ***king dependency and MAKE. IT. WORK.
        8.
        9.
        10.

        Kailash suggested official tool 4 porting python2 to python3 (fixes openDR)
          The tool's called 2to3.
            usage: 2to3 -w py2.py => py3_version_of_py2.py.py
      Then see whether tensorflow 1.12 can run render_smpl.py.  There's just GOTTA BE a way to get that to work.

      Prob start installs on cat4?
        Maybe we can remove chumpy and go from there.
          Seems somewhat hazardous.  Trying instead to cycle through conda environments and run "p3 measure.py" in each one.































  Problems:
    tf 1.12 (what Vishal used to get deeplab working) has no python2 version (I THINK.)
    opendr (necessary for any kind of visualization in HMR) has no python3 version.

    So:
      We either need to downgrade Vishal's deeplab tensorflow calls.  (More support for this)
        OR
      fix "up" opendr (less community around openDR, and I think Loper works for Amazon these days)
        OR
      use sketchy shell scripts to hack around the problem whenever we need to call render_smpl.py from BNN.py (probably not a scalable solution)

      I'm 1st going to try to downgrade Vishal's deeplab tensorflow calls
        THEN: I'm going to try reimplementing deeplab in python2?  (adapt away Vishal's ****ing code sh!t)
        Then MAYBE I'm going to try building a diff segmentation implementation (matterport:  https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)


  Try getting (all the "cat" packages you need) working on python2 in a virtualenv similar to HMR.  We could also try to do it in conda...
    One of the biggest things I hate about this idea (python2) is simply that python2 WILL become deprecated.  But at least it'll work for a bit, and [this](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html) will tell you how to migrate to python3.

  Find the piece of ***t shell script where you put the 1st HMR venv setup.
    Then you'll be able to get an MVP working.


  The problem is SOMEWHERE in OSMesa and/or opendr and/or chumpy.

  Get glfw installed.  First, I have to get sudo privileges back.  It may be worth installing self-control (or some similar software) at that rate.
  Then we gotta do glfw and opendr installation (https://github.com/polmorenoc/opendr), b4 checking for chumpy errors.

  Whatever you do, DO NOT LEAVE 
    "   #from chumpy.ch import *  " in ~/anaconda3/envs/cat4/lib/python3.6/site-packages/chumpy/__init__.py .
  It may look fine right now, but something WILL BREAK in chumpy at some pt in the future.

      1st, I'm going to try to downgrade Vishal's deeplab tensorflow calls

  Fix the conda environment (python3 cat12 but with hmr dirs too.)
  Wait, is this 100% necessary?
    Yeah, probably, to get chumpy & openDR for render_SMPL.py.





  BNN big picture:
    Loop 'til loss/cost/ function is low enough:
      1.  Fit SMPL to proper vertical proportions (ie.   A. (z_shoulders - z_hip),    & B. (z_hip - z_min)   &  C. (height-shoulders))
        a.  Knees
        b.  Crotch
        c.  Belly 
          1.  (max circumference besides the arms)
        d.  Arm length
        e.
        f.
        g.
        h.
        i.
        j.

        u.
        v.
        w.
        x.
        y.
        z.
        We can add knees and/or nose, etc. later
      2.  Fit SMPL to proper circumference proportions (ie. waist, chest, hips)
    Repeat steps 1 & 2 alternatingly, getting more fine-tuned as we go.

  Find the ass height on an arbitrary SMPL mesh (in T-pose)
    Find the furthest-back-in-y points and 
    Find the one closest to the z-midpt

  How do we deal with the fact that "closest" is not well-defined?

Pseudocode:                                           (this func should be placed somewhere within mesh_err()
  1.  Sort all verts by y value
  2.  Iterate thru them
                                                    TODO: mess with param 1/8!
  3.    1st pt that is within 1/8 of body height away from height midpt is in the butt.  "butt peak"
  4.  From here, find the hip height as specified by openpose keypoints.

  1st, just try to tune SMPL to have the "right proportions"
    1.  crotch is in right place, 
    2.  pantsline (waist) is in the right place, 
    3.  ankle is in the right place, 
    4.  shoulders are in the right place
    5.
  Right now we're going to assume we're generating the mesh with render_smpl.py, NOT HMR.
________________________________

    Heights:
      Crotch
      Waist
      Ankle
        (inseam)
      Shoulder

    What we ALREADY HAVE in openpose:
      Hip
      Ankle
      Shoulder
________________________________

    Widths:
      Chest
      Waist
________________________________

    How (pseudocode):
     We assume RENDER_SMPL, not HMR.  (ie. T-pose)
      Shoulder is a local max in z.
      We really really want the waist, more than anything else.
      Maybe waist is a local min in circumference?




  But how do we find these points on the SMPL mesh?

  5.  Crotch as halfway point between mask's crotch and openpose's "hip" height

  1.  Convert measurements to inches
    Feet adjustment (x dist)
    How do we translate the openpose keypoints from 2D (xy) photos to the 3D (xyz) locations on the SMPL mesh?????
  2.  SEPARATELY, get the circumference (perimeter) at the hip, chest, etc.
  3.  Camera must be stationary during filming
    a.  (see MTailor's method; put the phone on the ground, angled up, and do your rotation, trying to keep your axis of rotation as still as humanly possible)

  4.  Use A) the points from keypoints JSON and   B) cross-reference with the SMPL mesh   to find the loss function for the BetaNeuralNetwork

  I tried plugging in some openpose keypoints JSON to HMR, and it didn't seem to affect the end result.  So if I have to fix it up, I have to go into HMR's guts (code) and fix it manually.

  Looking for good inseam measurement on the SMPL mesh (3-D vertices, rather than on a 2-D image)
    At 1st, just use l2_dist(Heel, crotch)

  convert openpose keypoints json measurements to inches.

  def convert_openpose_json_to_inches(measures):
    # TODO: adapt func measure_body_viz(json_fname, front_fname, side_fname, cust_height)   to this more general version of the function 






  Where is the waist (where should we wear our pants?) relative to openpose keypoint "landmarks" and mask "landmarks"
    Then inseam = waist-crotch 
  But first, let's use openpose and SMPL (either HMR or BNN) to get a bunch of diff metrics and fit the shape params to each (ie. elbow to belly button, etc.)
    This will (ideally) allow us to get the shape params (betas) as correct as possible.

    But first, let's use openpose and SMPL (either HMR or BNN) to get a bunch of diff metrics and fit the shape params to each (ie. elbow to belly button, etc.)
      This will (ideally) allow us to get the shape params (betas) as correct as possible.


  Jeans ought to lay somewhere right above the hips (actually far below the belly button)
    But they also ought to not fall off.  So we have to get it right.  I'm not even 100% sure openpose will do it right.

  TRY HMR WITH OPENPOSE JSON.





  Somehow get openpose keypoints, but add:
    1.  Crotch
      a.
    2.  Inseam loc (heel?)

  Use yourSELF to find the betas from HMR.
  You have (roughly) the betas that match your own body, so if HMR works at all, you ought to be able to get it working
    Aren't the betas just 70:80?  If we trust that there are 69 pose params.
    If we really must KNOW, we can try to set the pose params from HMR to A-pose and do a "diff" between the result we get from render_SMPL.py
    HMR doesn't go all the way down (ie. it assumes I'm shorter than I am)


  Schedule trip to LA to integrate everything.
    Bus?

  Find loc(betas) in Thetas.npy.
  blender meshes to compare, try multiple (70:80, 69:79, etc.), etc




  In HMR, everytime you run the new thing, paralellize (split it into thread 1 that shows with visualize_() and thread 2 that saves the .obj mesh, prints out the supposed betas, )
    Probably too slow.  Is it worth spending the time to make this shiny new perfect tool?
      No, we just wanna find the betas.







  How 2 check which part of params are the betas?
    Maybe try an extreme body and ID the most extreme value in the Thetas.  ie. 
      1.  Jonah Hill
      2.  Lebron James
      3.  Some midget, etc.
      4.  Jared Leto          skinny
      5.

    1.  Grab what you think are the betas
    2.  Show a model overlaid over the picture with default HMR
    3.  Try to see whether that model is the same shape as one produced by /home/n/x/p/fresh____as_of_Dec_12_2018/vr_mall____fresh___Dec_12_2018/smpl/smpl_webuser/hello_world .  This would be easier with a super-extreme body like Jonah Hill, Lebron James, some midget, etc.
    4.
    5.
    6.














    But still TODO: which parts of the params are the betas?
      tried 69:79, etc.
      tried 68:78, etc.
      I tried these b/c hmr.pdf says the first 23x3 values are the pose params theta, then it lists the betas as the next 10 values.


  Figure out exactly where the betas are.

  Aggregate all the HMR code into a single directory.
























  Next, we can do BNN on the betas.

  1.  get numpy out of HMR tf
    DONE.






  Very simple fix is to feed images into HMR that are of one of the following sizes (the following are all included in HMR):
    ( 96, 159, 3)   # 1963
    (157, 114, 3)   # 1954
    (224, 224, 3)   # (all of the coco.png images) coco1.png

  How to maximize hmr performance:
    Images should be tightly cropped, where the height of the person is roughly 150px

    So crop, similar to vishal's deeplab.
      skimage.
      mask=skimage.transform.resize()
      Image.resize()
      One way to get the Image to call img.resize(new_shape) on, is grab an image from a video through cv2:  to do "cv2.imread(filename)" `vidcap  = cv2.VideoCapture(vid_local_path); success, img  =vidcap.read()`

  Maybe simple recursion doesn't work b/c vert still goes down but doesn't cross to the other side of "height"

  Check how we're getting the initial next_point() in triang_walk() or walk_recurs().

  A.  To get the perimeter, take a plane that intersects each of the triangles in the SMPL mesh, then take the ConvexHull.
    More detail:
      
    1.  Sort the vertices near the plane (just like we did in cross_sec()),
      a.  Do "Triangle walk" along the .obj mesh triangles, straddling the proper height
        1.  Find faces including both the starting vertices
          a.  
        2.  Take 3rd vert
        3.  if high:
          a.  Take vert_bot and 3rd vert and recurs,
        4.  elif low:
          a.  Take vert_top and 3rd vert and recurs,
        5.  Return vertices as a list; when you hit the head with the tail, return the whole chalupa
        6.
    # TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO TODO
        7.
      b.

    2.  Make a dictionary where each vertex idx (ie. vert1:[face1,face2,face3], 2:[], is the key to a list of faces,
    3.  Find the other adjacent vertices' xyz locs  vs[idx]
    4.  Do the triangle through them,
    5.  Determine whether the plane intersects the triangle,  (ie. is z==5 greater than one of the vertices and less than another of the vertices?)
    6.  Get the lines of intersection,      This is the part I'm not 100% sure on yet, but it should be doable.
    7.  Find the points where the lines of intersection intersect,   (ie. the perimeter of the convex hull of the polygon of the smpl mesh's intersection with the plane)
    8.  Get the convexHull around those points,
    9.  Calculate the perimeter of that convex Hull.
    10.

  BNN:
    Betas neural net   (wiggles the betas until the SMPL mesh best fits the circumferences we take from the video-body-measurements)


  Try mTailor properly to see whether it works

  Slow rotation of lazy susan
    Buy used motor in Wilmington

  That (motor) would be for a super-high-end version of the product
  There's also the computer vision / graphics projection-mapping to consider.
    Orthographic view != real camera view
    Simply put, the input to a camera is not perfectly Cartesian.  To properly mask the voxels, we either need to map the mask or the image to the "Cartesian" view

  I actually think we NEED the 360 degree video to make the surface mesh properly.  We need enough images that we can throw out the noisy A) images and B) masks.

  Or maybe the 3+ measurements would be enough (waist, chest, hips)














































    But EVEN IF we do absolutely EVERYTHING necessary:
      1.  Mapping perspective to the "Cartesian" numpy voxels    (ie. how an infinite road ahead of you would look like it vanishes at the horizon, but actually the sides of the road are parallel so the road couldn't POSSIBLY vanish)
        a.
      2.  Tossing noisy video frames (images)
      3.  Tossing noisy segmentation masks
      4.  Properly training the "neural network" to "learn" the right SMPL model
        a.  ie. wiggle the betas
      5.  Center the masks on the SMPL model such that the points actually correspond to each other
      6.  Rescale the masks to the size of the SMPL model
      7.  Make it run QUICKLY enough that people don't get bored waiting (~17 seconds without another person in the room)
      8.  Fit the customer's face onto the SMPL mesh's face and make it look not-creepy (ie. add blinking, whatever else people find uncanny about virtual avatars)
      9.
      10.
      11.
      12.

      14.
      15.
      16.
      17.
      18.

    People still might not want it and we'd have to sell sell sell.  But maybe by that time, the market would actually be ready for such a product (ie. more developers making apps for Oculus) and we'd be able to find customers more easily.  But then they also have to either A) buy the motorized lazy susan or B) live within walking distance of one of us.
    Anyway, that's the 50,000 foot view; I don't really have time to worry about this right now.  But I DO know there's just far too many SMPL betas to tune them each manually.  The only possible successful route involves getting 80% of the way to 
    Plus, the margin on clothing sales can't be that great.  That's probably why people insist on doing AR/VR with furniture instead; the higher the profit margin, the better the business.

    But I may as well see it through.  I would regret it otherwise.  Plus, how am I going to have anything on my resume if I quit?  Nah, we're either gonna A) win or B) go down swinging.
    It may not take as long as you fear, though.  Besides, by the time it's all done, you'll be able to look back at everything and laugh.

  1.  Nipple-height-finding doesn't quite work.
    a.  Ideal solution involves a Conv neural network trained on labeled locations of people's nipples
      1.  And then a vertical shift from the front view to the size view (ie. bottoms of feet should be at same height)
        a.  The vertical shift ought to be more subtly tuned than I was doing earlier.  Perhaps the center of the top and bottom should be in the same place.
    b.  Oh wait but also women can't do that.  Unless we want bust size ON TOP of the breasts.  Hm.  Maybe for clothes that actually IS what we want.
  2.  The assumption that chest circumference is exactly an ellipse overshoots the actual chest measurement.
    a.  Solve by adding a constant?
  3.  If we reverse-engineer www.bodyvisualizer.com, we'll have to find a way to convert that mesh to SMPL.

Many other attempts to get proper segmentation from 720x1280 resolution video on my webcam, and they have all failed.  Therefore, without understanding why, I ought to be able to get proper results just by taking 360 degree video at home, if I can EVER get proper results from my shitty Ubuntu laptop webcam.

  Nyle
    weekend minimization



  Nathan's mini-goal for the day:
    I want to get the level where I can size people within 80% accuracy in a split second (ie. 2 minutes tops).
























  1. The algorithm for smpl_fit() should first find the most extreme feature and tune around that one.  (ie. Nathan's height)
    a.  This is the part I failed to do when first writing the code for "custom_body()" in smpl.py.
    b.
    c.
  2. Then tune around the 2nd most extreme feature (ie. Nathan's skinniness)
    a.  This is harder with something like "muscular"; we should probably give partial control to the user for something more "fuzzy" like that
    b.
    c.
    d.
    e.
  3.  The algorithm should (ideally) take masks of the person from each of the 360 degree views and measure error as some kind of cost function    "diff"
  4.  But this is difficult for stuff like Nathan's waist measurements, where tiny errors in the segmentation can wildly throw off the "sigma" (deviation from the mean/median)
  Then we should try to tweak each

  Modularity.  Modularity, testing, and more modularity.  THAT'S how it gets built.  And then after all the modules are finally tuned just right, I can do a codesprint and bang it all together?  Actually, it's probably not worth trying to sprint; "you have to go slow so you can go fast."
    So let's go frontend->backend: 
      1st) tune SMPL model on many male bodies (as few betas as possible, maybe ~3 of 'em), then 
      2nd) use intuitive measurements like height, waist to plug into smpl.py, then 
      3rd) get those measurements (height, waist, etc.) using a combination of openpose and some kind of segmentation.

    This is the schedule I can give to Dario!

    Use SSHFS.
    How does this work when the ec2 instance is off?

  In shell scripts, use `whoami` to automatically concatenate username (ie. ubuntu, ec2-user, or n)
    (this is better than dealing with all the hassle of Amazon CLI update-user.)
    in python, it's even easier to use ~/who.txt, but this is no good in a shell script obviously because it depends on the ~ shortcut

  We can automate when the ec2 instance is on/off


















































  *** TODO? rename instance n@ip-172-31-44-142...   Will save someone in the future (probably you, Nathan) a whole day of confused debugging!!!!
  It was kind of annoying to have to change all the paths, but dealing with that is at least a straightforward, well-defined task, whereas dealing with the AWS shit takes longer and it's unclear what you're supposed to do.  If you really MUST do it this way, here's where you start:
    aws iam update-user --user-name ec2-user --new-user-name n
 But also consider that then you have to configure all the keys, etc.  That can be someone's desk job some day; you don't have to get it PERFECT

    Scrape FB images
    Or just do it manually & ask my friends for their measurements  (put together a silly little form letter)
  Discuss the UI, ask Dario to put "asking for height and weight" in.  Also, someone needs to put all the pieces together.  I would suggest Dario.

  Maybe Oculus should connect to someone's desktop computer?  We could just ask them to take pictures on the computer rather than muck around with the smartphone stuff.  That's probably more immersive than constantly switching platforms.
  
  Give the customer a similar tool to bodyvisualizer.com where they can fine-tune their model.




  Don't mention this in the meeting, but after we have a full product, someone needs to go do customer discovery.  I would suggest Dario just because he's in NYC and it's a little more convenient.  (Also I kind of want him to just leave Simone alone and stop calling regular meetings)

  SMPL's CAESAR dataset is pay-to-play ($3500 for access)
  It might be better, rather than brute-forcing and either looking for free data or gathering your OWN data (also very time-consuming), might be better to just read the SMPL paper or do an all-in-one-shot version of the implementation using Photo-Wake-Up.




  What did I actually DO all morning?
    Double-check the git log

  Ask the guys: does Oculus still have to connect to someone's desktop computer?  We could just ask them to take pictures on the computer rather than muck around with the smartphone stuff.  That's probably more immersive.










 

  Within the UI, ask for customer's weight.
  We could get the height using Apple ARKit.  In the first iteration, let's get height by asking the customer directly.
  Ask gender
  Tell Dario to ask for this data (gender, weight, height,   ...,   perhaps exercise amount and/or inseam) in the beginning (in Oculus UI).  This way we don't have to make a separate website.

  If you could give them the basic stuff (given a few measurements, here's the general size of the body) within a week, you can go finish your job search without as many distractions and then move on to the next step with The Mall project














































  Fix Google's deeplab segmentation w.r.t. different image resolutions, dimensions, etc.

  From the beautiful end-to-end paper Vishal sent me;  FB research.

  3. Overview
    Given a single photo, we propose to animate the human
    subject in the photo. The overall system works as follows
    (Fig. 2): We first apply state-of-the-art algorithms to perform person detection, segmentation, and 2D pose estimation. From the results, we devise a method to construct a
    rigged mesh (Section 4). Any 3D motion sequence can then
    be used to animate the rigged mesh.
    To be more specific, we use Mask R-CNN [14] for person detection and segmentation (implementation by [30]).
    2D body pose is estimated using [38], and person segmentation is refined using Dense CRF [24]. Once the person is
    segmented out of the photo, we apply PatchMatch [4] to fill
    in the regions where the person used to be.

    End-to-end fitting would require me to have a person and various sizes of the clothing






  Clothing research:
    1.  Order many sizes of clothes
      a.  Try each on, catalogue your findings
      b.  We could also redirect people to Amazon / Big-And-Tall stores / whatever store
        1)  For instance, if we know something fits me at: a) Formal Affairs on Main Street, or b) Goodwill on Main Street, we could
          a)  Try to find someone nearby in Newark   who is shaped like me   who already has Oculus and sell them that piece of clothing.
          b)  Perhaps if I went to Main Street and did that, I could figure out how to make a 3-D model of a piece of clothing from Simone and sold some around here.  I wonder what the population density of Newark, DE is compared to Santa Monica.  It's DEFINITELY lower than Manhattan's.
    2.  Get on a VR subreddit or find where people are already hyped about Oculus and have it nearby, then release a beta on there.

  Software IP law (an answer from https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7184/how-much-of-a-codebase-can-be-considered-intellectual-property):
    Yes and no. [note, the following is all written about US law. In other jurisdictions laws are, of course, different (though usually not drastically so.)]
    In the US there are (at least) three different bodies of law that might apply to code: copyright, patents, trade secrets.
    Copyright covers original expression. Anything you write is automatically, immediately protected under copyright. The copyright applies to the code itself, and anything "derived" from that code. It's up to the courts to decide exactly what "derived" means. One case that's long been viewed as a landmark in this area is Gates Rubber v. Bando Chemicals. The Court of Appeals for the tenth Circuit decision includes a section titled: "The Test for Determining Whether the Copyright of a Computer Program Has Been Infringed." Note that you can register a copyright, and that can be worthwhile, such as helping recover some damages you can't otherwise.
    Patents are quite different from copyrights. Where a copyright covers expression of an idea, a patent covers a specific invention. Rather than being awarded automatically, a patent has to be applied for, and awarded only after the patent office has determined that there's no relevant prior art to prevent it from being awarded. A patent, however, covers things like somebody else independently discovering/inventing what's covered by the patent.
    A trade secret could (at least theoretically) apply to some process or procedure embodied in the code. A trade secret mostly applies to a situation where (for example) you're trying to form an alliance with some other company, and in the process tell them things you don't tell the general public. If you've identified the fact that what you're telling them is a trade secret, and they then tell a competitor (or the general public, etc.) or more generally use that information in any way other than the originally intended purpose, it could constitute a trade secret violation. As a side-note: patents and copyright fall under federal law, so they're basically uniform nation-wide. Trade secrets mostly fall under state law, so the exact details vary by state.
    Absent a reason to believe otherwise, I'd guess your interest here is primarily in copyright infringement. The key here would be showing that one piece of code was derived from the other. That is, it specifically would not apply in a case where there were only a limited number of ways of doing something, so anybody who wanted to do that had to use one of those ways. Since this would not indicate actual derivation, it would not indicate copyright violation.



The necessary prerequisites to ruling software, algorithms or code patentable:
  Purely abstract algorithms ruled unpatentable in Gottschalk v. Benson (1972).  This precedent has been mostly kept, but not 100% so.
  If implementation was nonconventional, or the process did effectuate a transformation of substances (ie. curing rubber in a mould), the algorithm, math, and/or computer program was patentable.  In our case, I'd imagine SMPL is pretty nonconventional; it required all that data to be gathered.  But did it embody an "inventive concept?"  Almost certianly not, right; if anyone had the right to patent the "inventiveness of the concept" it's someone like Geoff Hinton or an earlier developer of the Neural Network idea, not Black and co.
  Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible."
 
  The Court's 1978 ruling in Parker v. Flook,[14] was similar to Benson in principle. The Benson and Flook cases also established that a "clue" to whether a patent might be granted on a process was whether the process was carried out with a particular apparatus or else effectuated a transformation of an article from one state or thing to another state or thing. In Flook, where the sole departure from the prior art was concededly the formula or algorithm, no transformation was alleged, and it was conceded that the implementing apparatus was old or conventional, the process was simply not the kind of process that could be patented. The principle, stated in Flook, that to be patent eligible the implementation of an abstract idea or law of nature must be inventive, rather than routine or conventional, became of paramount importance in Supreme Court jurisprudence at the beginning of the 21st century. (This occurred in the Mayo and Alice cases.)

  In DDR Holdings v. Hotels.com,[32] the Federal Circuit upheld one patent and invalidated several others under Alice. THIS IS THE ONLY INSTANCE SINCE THE ALICE DECISION IN WHICH THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT HELD A PATENT TO BE ELIGIBLE. The court said that the eligible patent solved an Internet-centric problem in an inventive way. (It essentially framed one website within another, so that it appeared to be a part of the other site.)

  So maybe the PATENTS are not THAT defensible, but we need to make sure this is true of literal, character-for-character code-copying.  Particularly when the license SAYS I need to ask them for permission to use the code for commercial purposes.

  Mistakes:
    Procrastinating too much on implementing triangle area
    Perhaps I should have copied the code for n-sided polygon area?
  Successes!
    Triangle-area() seems to work!  I should probably scan the notes I used into pdfs and put them on my website or something...


  As of 4:07 P.M., I plan to double-check the triangle area a different way and then move on to implementing Delaunay Triangulation of an arbitrary set of points.  DTri is better than the convexHull b.c. cHull doesn't work for concave polygons
    Try it with this (http://www.qhull.org/html/qdelaun.htm)  if there's nothing in python/if python's implementation is too slow.

  3 mistakes today:
    I went to UD Smith Hall (comp sci)
    I was too disorganized.  Didn't write code agile-ly enough.  Always just start start start and then keep going

  Accelerators?
  Get out an MVP and start pitching it?

  The best result is if we can find/transition to something 100% remote so I can move to California whenever it's convenient later.

    Also ideal if something matches all my skillsets (automation, rather than brainless work like at Burger King)
      Probably apply to Newark/Philly software jobs.

  The second-best result is probably Tesla, even if it's not a tech position
    If it comes to a permanent role, try to discuss with the guys in person rather than via text (better to explain why, all the details, etc.)

________________________________

  Mall proj:
    Check whether Caffe is installed for CPU, then build openpose around the CPU version.
    Copy Dario's 3-month plan
      Go to a UD prof & ask about debugging deep learning

    1st, get conda working with seg.py again.
      Then, generalize the rotation process and angle-finding.
    Thereafter, try to get a general idea of how long this thing will take




























  What mistakes did you make today?
    Can we learn anything from them?  If so, what?

  Tell Vishal what I've learned?
  Maybe he just won't listen.  He has to make the mistakes himself to learn.





























    1)  Start looking
    2)  Make a giant list
    3)  Apply in a giant one-shot (as much as possible)

  List out all TODOs on Zoho
    Either 
      a)  Steal Tubingen's tech
        I think we're doing this
        OpenPose to get measurements instead of the shittier segmentation where I have to do sizing myself
      b)  Switch to plain sizing
      c)  Take a lot longer to finish


  Technical:
    Find the waist length.
    Get the "best" segmentation from the first few frames of the video

    Just have them enter their height.
    Make them spread their legs a bit so we can get the leg length from the crotch.

    Segment & get measurements at various locations (waist, legs).
      But HOW do we get the waist measurements?
        It's different for a fat person than for a skinny one
      Maybe a fixed amt above the crotch (or that fixed amt but adjusted for height)
    We must take the very very best segmentation among all the rotated images in order to reliably use our crotch-finding method
 

  Business:
    Start with used jeans
    Local Craigslist (esp. good for little kids that constantly outgrow pants, also abnormally sized people like myself and the tall mTailor guy on YouTube)
    Jeans shrink in the wash
    "inseam" means pant-leg-rim to the crotch, NOT to the waist

  List of competitors:
    https://fashionista.com/2014/07/8-tech-startups-tackling-clothing-fit

















  Funds:
    Lookup UD classes' start date
      Tutor by sneaking around as usual
      Put in Zoho Cal




  Save locs where I was last working in "TODO:_new.txt"

  gad seg.py measure.py TODO.txt && gci "measure.py:   wrote 'find_leg_length(mask,height)'     seg.py: made sure segmentation output only includes the points we're pretty certain are in the body (np.greater(mask, certainty))" && gpus






    We're not gonna do SMPL if we just want measurements; it's silly
      So we'll make a database of clothing sizes, get the charts right, make a clothes search engine.  Other things, honestly, aren't practical

  Technical:
    Figure out how to scale the SMPL model to the right proportions exclusively from a smartphone picture
    Find the points of a SMPL model (or otherwise compute a similarity function between 2 bodies)
      hmr DOESN'T GET thinness / height / body measurements
      Mess with params of the model in render.py?
        "betas"
        m = load_model( '../../models/basicModel_f_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl' )
        **** m.betas[:] = np.random.rand(m.betas.size) * .03 ****

      How to save .obj file from hmr dir?
























  Technical:
    Ensure mask is "contiguous" before using
    Take convHull of the mask?
      That's too extreme; only maybe a good idea locally
      The complete convHull would be convex; a convex polygon looks nothing like a human (Jesus pose)

  Business:
    Try to figure out how to get clothing meshes from Macy's, Kohl's, Wal-Mart, Gucci, Zara, etc.
      Hack 'em?
    Or maybe we can set up a remote attack so I can control their computers from home @ night
    Otherwise we can just use body-mesh similarity between 2 people to let them sell used clothing to each other
      We still would ideally prefer to show the user in the clothes, but by now that's probably impractical given our timeline and what I know about this process.
      Somehow we have to get the clothing from A to B though.
    It'll just be a shitty Craigslist-esque website.  That'll get us to ramen profitability.  Newmark is rich, but not THAT rich

    1.  Car show (Dario mentioned )
      a.  Go where rich people hang out
      b.  But you have to be able to talk to them in a substantive way (this guy liked car)

    3.  Trying to innovate
      a.  If you have no competition, you have no money
    4.  Thinking you are the customer
      a.  You need to get feedback
      b.  HTWFAIP (others' points of view)
    5.  Overvaluing the launch
      a.  Doesn't have to be perfect
      b.  Launch is just the 1st step

  Ask about Sansar:
    How good is it?
    It's something like ProdigyXAmazon.  VR version of "2nd life"
    "Social VR"
      ie. Runescape
    Try Sansar myself
    Cross-platform?
      Oculus-Internet possible?

  update progress on Zoho / Slack

=======================================================================

  1st make perfect (best possible) skin_nathan.npy
    Standardize alignment of the masks (ie. all to the belly button)
    Or weight the "downshift" of the masks by the length across of the widest mask (ie. if we have the full Jesus cross-section, take the length from fingertip to fingertip and that indicates we're looking at the person face-on)
      Whereas if the current length-across of the masks is small (side view), that means the CoM should be bumped up to match the CoM at the Jesus-view (front)
    Or at least CoM-adjustment for masking

    Maybe use the sin() of the angles of the length of the arms to determine the angle.  See how well it actually works, though.  Perhaps the simpler interpolation method is easier, but then we're assuming constant rotation speed

    We have to do the rotation s.t. it initially expands the possible locs before cutting off any out-of-bounds voxels.  Perhaps the best way to do this is to do the rotation, remove those "external" points, then do all the rounding and "model[idxes]=True"-setting

  Idea:
    Rotate bunch of voxel coordinates using simple 3x3 rotation matrix, then make a 2x2x2 block around each of the new voxel locations and turn those 8 voxels "on" in the rotated np array.
      Here the limiting step is conversion btwn data forms.
      Wait, how did I fucking not think of this before?  It's so beautifully simple.
      Is this faster than the other way of going through space voxel by voxel, doing the inverse rotation, and then checking whether the voxel nearest the inverse rotated point is on?
        Potentially, because this way we're only dealing with the locs that are "on"
        I could dream up an optimization where we constantly keep a running "checklist" of the voxels that are "on" (in a hashtable) and remove things whenever the corresponding rotated pt is turned "off" by a masking.  This way we don't have to convert as much; just have to make sure we do the angle math right
        The reason this is faster is I can use ANY previously optimized matrix-processing code to do this rotation; it's just a single matrix multiplication.  Hrm...

      Is this faster than the other way of going through space voxel by voxel, doing the inverse rotation, and then checking whether the voxel nearest the inverse rotated point is on?
        Potentially, because this way we're only dealing with the locs that are "on"
        I could dream up an optimization where we constantly keep a running "checklist" of the voxels that are "on" (in a hashtable) and remove things whenever the corresponding rotated pt is turned "off" by a masking.  This way we don't have to convert as much; just have to make sure we do the angle math right
        The reason this is faster is I can use ANY previously optimized matrix-processing code to do this rotation; it's just a single matrix multiplication.  Hrm...

  Try ndimage.rotate() on basic 3-d model
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47197748/rotate-with-scipy-without-interpolation
  Use floats/ints instead of bools!  Convert back to bool later!
    Tried, fixes the problem of holes INSIDE the mask, but generates lots of +noise (1s where there oughta be 0s) OUTSIDE the mask
  Ask on StackOverflow
    better, faster version of ndimage.rotate()
  Use cat_opencv3

  The best result is if I can find something 100% remote so I can move to California whenever it's convenient later.
    Also ideal if something matches all my skillsets (automation, rather than brainless work like at Burger King)
    1)  Start looking
    2)  Make a giant list
    3)  Apply in a giant one-shot (as much as possible)
      Probably apply to Newark/Philly software jobs.

  The second-best result is probably Tesla.
    Even if it's not a tech position
    If it comes to this, try to tell the guys in person rather than via text (better to explain why, all the details, etc.)

    Give Vishal some money for his contribution upon the valuation of the company at a certain dollar amount.
      Split evenly 4 ways
        Pierlorenzo Peruzzo, Nathan Bendich, Simone Zamparini, and Dario Gentiletti agree to each take 25% of the equity of the Virtual Clothing Mall company (name pending, not yet incorporated) evenly (25% each).  But this equity will be given to each of us a little bit each month, for 4 years after July 1st, 2019. on the 1st of each month.
        This contract will be void if and when any of these 3 happen.  All 4 founders must agree for any of these to take place:
          1.  Outside investment
          2.  Adding a new equity holder (ie. employee or founder)
          3.  Change of business entity type (according to [A], we should be a Delaware C-Corp)

        This contract was based on the informal agreement detailed in [B]
          [A] https://mashable.com/2016/01/27/startup-business-structure/#0FKCY7e7sGqh
          [B] https://www.docracy.com/35/founders-equity-agreementl
        Non-Disclosure Agreement: we (the four named above) agree to not disclose any details of the project to people outside the four founders after January 8th, 2019, unless for the purposes of fundraising, which must be agreed upon by all four founders.  If one of the four does so and the other three founders agree sharing the information hurt the company's interests, the other three may take away 1% of the total equity of the company from the one who said too much and split that 1% three ways (0.333% each)

        The 4 years was taken from the fact that Amazon took almost exactly 3 years from incorporation date to IPO.  I bet what we're doing is harder than what Amazon tried to do.  Regardless, 4 years is plenty of time to tell who's committed to it for the long run.

    Few lines of code written, but plenty of debugging is in the works.
  Thursday  Nov. 15: ~10 lines, but good debugging of how the rotation should ACTUALLY be
  Saturday  Nov. 17: ~20 lines, but good debugging of how the rotation should ACTUALLY be (fixed a bug that was making it stretch the A variable by 2 [sphere into reasonably extreme ellipsoid])
  Tuesday   Nov. 20: had a good chat with Dario and co. about what Einstein will become

  Pose Vishal the Bezos "regret minimization framework"
    Which would you regret more:
      Missing out on Google
        or
      Missing out on Cat??

  As much as possible, don't rely on 1 person and don't put yourself in positions where u have to rely on some special talent like that.
    And do an Elon where you pick their brain for all that shit so it all ends up in YOUR brain at the end of the day.

  Meet Michael

    Code the rotation
  Meet Mathew Pregasen

  If this doesn't work, start selling Juuls door to door
    If u sell in NYC (CUNY, Columbia, etc.), can jack up the price b/c of tax reasons
    Mint, Mango, and the Juul itself

        TODO: post asking where the retailers buy from
      Claims Creme Brulee is popular.  Definitely not what I saw at 7-11, but maybe more globally this is true.
      At UD, p sure it goes: Mint, Mango, Cucumber, Menthol, Fruit, Creme Brulee, and lastly Tobacco
      How low can we go on pod delivery prices???

    Then expand to an app
      Then expand the app to clothing?

  Bring tutoring clothes

  The product I'd pay for is clothes that fit.  That's it.
    Not the 3-D viz unless it's REALLLY good
      So we'll just have to make it stinking good.

  Code:
    Run mesh.rkt on _model.txt
    Keep better track of bugs
      Use software like Fog Creek's???

    Go line-by-line in the algebra or code and figure out the problem with the sphere initialization
      Are all-small-values reasonable?  Will they work?
        At least the sphere is a simple unit test case
      Center the sphere for unit test
      PROBLEM??: penalizes too-large values of A,B,C,...J in dist_single_pt_heuristic()
        I'm not sure if this is actually wrong, though.  All that oughta matter is the RELATIVE value of A,B,C,...J to each other, right?
    Smart (human-body-tuned) kmeans initialization

    Surface fitting is not working atm.  Debug!
      Pick 3 pts >> plane
      We can solve for the plane of least variance
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15959411/fit-points-to-a-plane-algorithms-how-to-iterpret-results
        The intercept doesn't matter
      Rotate plane and points to make calculating maxima and minima easier
        Start with known pts to figure out normal vector directions
        https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1167717/transform-a-plane-to-the-xy-plane

        10 pts should be flexible (we should at least get every extremum)

        4th pt should be farthest pt from that plane.  Then somehow we have to fit the rest?
          Maybe we can pick all 10 of the points by distance from the plane, then repick 5 of 'em for the next iteration
        Keep dictionary of pts used to update; we want to make sure to sample from all regions of the space
          Imagine a camel's (with 3 humps)'s back; you can't get the right surface by only looking at the extrema: you need the midpoints as well!
      I think we should not translate the surfaces b/c it doesn't help us.  It actually hurts, because there's no way of easily translating them back (except maybe moving all the points too, but then we'd have to change a hell of a lot of Racket code as well)
        DONE
      Which parts of the human body really need the high-definition detail?  And how do we get that detail?
        Currently we're simplifying using the quadric for speed's sake, but consider how well that will work on the following body parts:
          Face
            Nose
            Eyes
            Ears
          Hands
          Toes
          Anything "pointy," ie.
            Elbows
            Knees
        This all means that we should deform the triangle mesh after we initialize:
          The quadrics (smooth, fairly easily differentiable surfaces) are just for the big picture lay of the land
          For those particular body parts, we should be tweaking more and more based on detailed photographs
            But this is mainly for super persnickety users

    Cut down on UPDATING time by randomly picking from points to fit to (SGD rather than minibatch GD)

    Rewrite everything in Common Lisp

    Vectorize the masking code
      Or else remove a for loop some other way

    Smarter k-means initialization
    Better surface fit  (initialize better, or adjust better?  probably bit of both )
        1)  Take the file written and find the closest 2 pts btwn the k lists.  Then start stitching from there
        2)  Go from the outsides of each surface (on the edges of each bound set) 
        3)  Means have to be "adjacent" for stitching to occur.  Perhaps we should assume only a certain number of means will meet?  So iterate through the means and take the nearest 3 (as long as the 3rd isn't "behind" the first two)
    Mask by turning cylindrical back into Cartesian and masking in a vectorized way across the model

NOTE:
  actually coding the stitching algorithm took only 2 days (only ~10 hours).  Admittedly, I had to spend a good amount of time ruminating on it and working out many of the details in my head before it could colme to fruition, and the time complexity is currently abysmal.

    Better surface fit  (initialize better, or adjust better?  probably bit of both )
        1)  Take the file written and find the closest 2 pts btwn the k lists.  Then start stitching from there
        2)  Go from the outsides of each surface (on the edges of each bound set) 
        3)  Means have to be "adjacent" for stitching to occur.  Perhaps we should assume only a certain number of means will meet?  So iterate through the means and take the nearest 3 (as long as the 3rd isn't "behind" the first two)
    Stitch together the 2 surfaces

the fear of looking bad than by the hope of getting millions

    kmeans, triangular meshing
    


    Our reduction algorithm ought to take 4 pts which are close Manhattan-distance-wise and are not interrupted by any distant points and turn them into 3 points.  Whenever it successfully does so, it will reduce the number of faces by 3 (imagine a tetrahedron and then a single triangular planar face of that tetrahedron; that's the level of compression we can get.
    It should be initailized by kmeans (each mean will determine the points that should be looked through in finding the 4th point to remove).

    After we use this (4 -----> 3) reduction algorithm, we will probably want to use a neural network to fit a manifold to the remaining skin points.  Hopeuflly we won't have to train this neural net on extant skin model data, or if we DO have to use Michael J. Black's materials, we can get his (IP) Intellecual Property with permission or little risk of legal consequence.
        We may (I hope we don't have to, but we may) need to rewrite a graphics library entirely for this particular problem, just to prove to lawyers that we didn't steal anyone's VR IP.  It's possible we could grab some good shit from Unity, Oculus, or someone else, but most likely that will not solve the precise problem I'm trying to solve.  Perhaps the (manifolds --> Unity) problem is a doable one, and then that will be the problem I need to solve rather than rewriting all the graphics libraries myself.

    Should we shine speckled lights on a person's body,
        ("active illumination" as CV professionals call it),
        The depth of a point is proportional to the radius (area?) of the circle
        The angle of the plane tangential to the skin at that point is proportional to 
            A) the eccentricity of the ellipse and 
            B) the direction in which that ellipse points

        Then we ought to stitch together the various planes somehow.
        The method is similar to the approximation a la derivative as done by Euler?  Gauss?
            ie. where you do f(x+del) = f(x) + del f'(x)
        We can mathematize (formalize) this later and make an algorithm of it.

    Hang the bluescreen (tape it at some height)
    Take pictures in front of it
    See how well they segment




    First week:
        Exploration
    2nd week:
        Take good photographs
    3rd week:
        Segmentation
    4th week:
        Extract pants size from segmented images
    5th week:
        Scrape web for pants
    6th week:
        UI (suggest the pants to the user)

Nathan's action plan example:
    1.  Submit photos
    2.  
    3.  
    4.  
    5.  
    6.  
    7.  
    8.  
    9.  Nathan's only concerns are whether we can make the clothing fit realistically without IP from someone like Michael Black.  So he suggests we just take pictures of the person, see whether we have any clothing that fits peoiple similarly shaped to that user, and recommend that clothing if we have it.  Then, if they buy, we make royalties.
        The user will see suggested clothing and a guarantee that that clothing will fit them.  They will also be able to pick their favorite colors, pattern they like, and style of clothing (ie. jeans vs. slacks).  I like the idea of icons and buttons rather than just a search bar, but if they want to type in a specific color/style we haven't shown with buttons, there should be a search bar as well.  It's an app, not a physical booth.  The booth is part of the picture-acquiring and segmentation process used to help size the user so we can recommend clothing that fits and will flatter their body type.  So they will open an app that looks something like Amazon and be able to purchase things in a familiar way, but they have to know the clothes will fit when they arrive.
        "Buy" and "next" buttons.
        I was thinking the only source of revenue would be comissions on the sold clothing.


Vishal's action plan example:
    1.  Submit photos
    2.  
    3.  
    4.  
    5.  
    6.  
    7.  
    8.  
    9.  Open the app. Load a set of recommended clothes. See if they fit. Buy them, earn royalty. And display "recommendations", not "ads" in the surrounding mall 

    Clarifying questions:
        Are the recommended clothes displayed on the user's body?
        Do they come from nearby stores?  Neighbors?  Distant sellers?
        How closely do they need to fit?

    Nathan's thoughts:
        When someone buys a $10 shirt, Nathan and Vishal make $0.30 (this is what Vishal means by "royalty")
        This is what I mean by "commission" (royalties)
_____________________________

    Planning out "is this venture going to be profitable and how?" is , in my opinion, not the best use of our time, because it's hard to predict the future.  So if people talk too much about vision and predicting the fturure rather than starting the actual (technincal) work, that irritates me a bit because it feels like I'm wasting my time.
    I also know that Elon Musk doesn't write business plans anymore for precisely this reason.  And even if we are nothing like Elon Musk, we can still learn from this part of his action because he has started more businesses than us and has succeeded more than most people ever succeed.

Cat pipeline:
    1.  Take pictures
    2.  Segment pictures
        a.  Blue-screen
        b.  GIMP
    3.  Build 3-D model from masks
        a.  "Recover Last Session"
        b.  Can we get each pixel on each mask to map to a single point in Blender?
            1)  Then moreover, we'll need to describe the almost-infinitely-many faces that make up the topology of a human body
        c.  
    4.  Color 3-D model
    5.  Segment out clothing
    6.  Put on new clothing

============================================================================
Cat pipeline:
    1.  Take pictures
        a.  How do we get uniform speed on the Lazy Susan?
============================================================================
        For next few days, we're focused on segmentation.  Let's hang the bluescreen and take pics
        Red light?  Green light?
        Account for the natural slowdown of the Lazy Susan due to coeff of friction mu and account for that in the rotation speed W (omega).  This way we can accurately acquire the 90 degree, 180 degree, 45 degree, etc. pictures.
============================================================================
    2.  Segment pictures
        a.  Blue-screen
        b.  GIMP
============================================================================
    3.  Get measurements
        a.  Waist
        b.  Inseam (height to waist)
    4.  Scrape web for pants that fit that size
        a.  Helps to have a tailor on our payroll / as a cofounder
    5.  Offer pants


============================================================================
Ideas for how to get measurements:
============================================================================
    3.  Ask for jeans measurements of similarly shaped people.  Then we have to measure similarity somehow (either by 3-D models or height or somethin else)
        a.  We'll have to go to a tailor for this, but it can definitely be done.
        b.  We also need a significant datastore of people and their measurements.  But this can be done in time once we have a tailor on board our staff.
============================================================================

    1.  Haar cascades to belly button (or other notable feature)
        a.  Even for this, we have a problem b/c not everyone's belly button is at the same height relative to their inseam.
        b.  This also relies on us being able to see the belly buttons.
    4.  Include height of known object in the picture next to person's leg/general body part
    6.  Get a picture of them with friends and estimate their measurements by hand
    7.  Get pictures nude or close to nude, from front and back, and measure each thickness of their leg @ each pixel height
   12.  Find crotch (first break in mask) and estimate from there
        a.  Even for this, we have a problem b/c not everyone's crotch is at the same height relative to their inseam.
    2.  Form 3-D model of person from 2-D pictures and acquire the measurements that way
        a.  Complex.  Perhaps more complex than is required.
   10.  Paper (Clothes Size Prediction from Dressed-human Silhouettes)
        a.  Copy their (the Chinese') methods 
   11.  Model every atom in the person's body
        a.  Too hard for MVP
    8.  SMPL
        a.  Copyrighted
    9.  Train a CNN on a bunch of image and/or mask data that includes inseam, waist
        a.  Too complex?
        b.  Where do we get the labeled data?
    5.  Identify the exact article of clothing the person is wearing, catalog it, and get the measurement(s) from that
        a.  Prob too much work

    Have people compete over selling you the thing
    You can place a bounty on an item if you literally need it in 10 minutes before you go to work
    Borrowing that item is also allowed
    Hrm, this only really works for stuff like suits, right?
    But that could still be a viable business model: being a suits marketplace and lending-facility

    The VR comes later
    Rather than writing up some huge analytical argument, just post the friggin' ad and see whether people in our own f***ing community will give us their stuff

The beginning of what could become a revolution:
    "Hi, we're getting rid of your old stuff for you!  If you're moving out and have anything you can't sell, we'll give you a nickel for each item.  We live in unit 376: Nathan Bendich and Vishal Anand."
    Other logistics:
        1.  If you have to move out within the day and we're not currently there, you can leave your stuff and send an e-mail to nxbendich@yahoo.com with your venmo username and you'll get your money by the end of tomorrow.
        2.  If you need something and don't want to A) wait for it to ship or B) pay for shipping, contact nxbendich@yahoo.com for inquiries.  We predict we'll get quite a few of the following: mattresses, sheets, and pillows.

    Pivot: Cleenerz
        I still need jeans, but we have to be a marketplace.
            I need jeans fast.  I need jeans tomorrow.  I need jeans next door.
            We store user data (2-3 things they need recurringly and can't find anywhere else).
            It's like AirBnB meets Amazon meets StackOverflow.  YOu can sell it out of your house, you get rating, and you GET NOTIFIED AS SOON AS SOMEONE POSTS WHAT YOU WANT.
            It has to fit around your life.  It has to not waste your time (be better than FB Marketplace or craigslist).  It has to be scam-free (SOverflow-style no-spammers reputation to prevent the Craigslist problem)
            Basically, it just formalizes neighbor-neighbor transactions and makes it easier for you to get whatever you need.  There are thousands of these apps out there, but for some reason none of them quite has dominance?  I guess Amazon does, kinda, but it's not fast enough and return-to-sender is too hard.
            We acquire and exchange rare items:
                MTG cards
                Old porn
                Weirdly-shaped bodies (lanky and tall like me)
                Obscure sports apparel
                Weird books

                Old video games
                Lessons on Google Fiber
            Limited time only!  Sales
                This way people only have to hold shit for like 2 weeks (1 week?) and also it'll sell faster.
            Should be tailored to people who are moving out so they have hella shit to dump.
            We can also fish around trash cans in the beginning.  Free stuff is where our margin comes in.
            We can go super duper old school and rather than selling an app, we can just have the thing buzz a tiny radio antenna in your pocket
            One radio antenna should be for general "there's a new thing at the local store" announcement and the other should be for "there's something very similar to what you've bought before" announcement.  Because there are always stupid ppl like Janie in the world who like to buy stupid cheap shit and we should make a tiny bit of money everytime that happens.

        We have to be so bloody easy to figure out that oldsters and youngsters can both use us equally easily.

    In the morning, figure out the pants problem
    Vishal is the type to manically figure out the other problem
        You're the analytical, reflective type to identify the need, and concentrate your forces until it's fucking done.
        Fucking done.
    Write Vishal the letter about climbing mountains to find a pot of gold at the top.

    Wear those jeans out, betch.  See you in the fucking morning.

        a.  How do we get uniform speed on the Lazy Susan?
            a) Ideation:
                5)  Have 'em push 'emselves and then drop the rod to assume a proper pose
                2)  Push 'em with an external rod
                    a)  Cheaper than motor
                    b)  But here we have to do calculation using coeff of fric
                3)  Fan
                4)  Have 'em jump on w/ particular velocity and use it to turn the Susan
                1)  Motor
                    a)  Cord to wind/unwind the table

    Calculations for "rolling resistance" (the reason the ball bearings might slow down at all) acquired from the following physics website:
https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/rolling-resistance.html

    An easier solution, considering we don't have perfectly round, oiled ball-bearings, is to programmatically calculate when the thickness of the mask is minimal and maximal (maximal at points forward or backwards, minimal at points where the body is facing right or left).
        Then we could calculate 45 degree, 30 deg, 60 deg angles with a fair amt of certainty

  Forwards:

    1.  Initialize an SMPL model from 1st pic (establish a "1st pic": ideally one where we can see all the limbs and we have data for a SMPL model in that pose)
    2.  Do something like SGD on model; use each new picture @ a diff angle to update the model's thickness parameters.  If we were to re-do SMPL, we'd want to be able to tune every tiny detail.  But that's very much a long-term (not at all MVP) kind of problem.
    3.  Minimize MSE (or other Objective Function) of (curr_model - segmentation of curr_theta_view)
        a.  This requires a constant (highly precise) angular velocity applied to the turntable.
    4.  Tweak each radius on the body individually


























_____________________________

    For demo:
        1)  Person (Jen Aniston) walks around with old clothes on,
        2)  Then with no clothes,
        3)  Then with new clothes

    .pkl files are the SMPL representations.  I'm still not 100% sure whether they're in .npy format, but also idk how much that matters
_____________________________

    For final:
        Simulate every particle in the entire human body (organs included?) for highest fidelity.
            Idk how much memory dedicate purely to the physics is required for this
_____________________________

    Merge all taking***.mp4 files so we have 10 hrs real music (just in case, lol.  We could probably make it a 20-hr marathon if we really need 2, lols)

    1)  Segment and model legs
        a)  Use pose estimation & Tubingen datasets
        EDIT: As of Fri, Jun  8 (14:13:40 PDT 2018), my understanding is that SMPL AND DMPL (SMPL + soft tissue deformations) are our best bet for realistic movement, body deformations, etc.  These models can be derived froma  single image with some level of fidelity, and (perhaps most importantly) they are easily rotatible, resizable, deformable, and portable to various platforms (Unity, etc.)
        As for getting a SMPL model out of a single image, see https://github.com/akanazawa/hmr.  

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

            SMPL:  (presumably Michael J. Black talking)
            The parameters of the model are learned from data including the rest pose template, blend weights, pose-dependent blend shapes, identity-dependent blend shapes, and a regressor from vertices to joint locations.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________






Question: How is DMPL different from Dyna?
    Both do soft-tissue
    My best guess rn is that Dyna is triangle-based (it only tracks the skin)
    Therefore, it's not compatible with Unity3D, Maya, Blender, UnrealEngine, etc.

    Is DMPL open-source just like SMPL?
    The way SMPL works is by tracking a few key points on the human body (joints) and extrapolating the skin from these points via "weights" on these various body regions.  So the first step is probably to get SMPL running on Unity or Blender for the demo (MVP).

Get James the key



    1)  Segment and model legs
    2)  start scraping the internet for sizing data & figure out 
Hire Michael Black (no, just see what code you can grab)
    How do we build the legs?
        Triangles in the mesh
        Is that better than the particle/voxel model I'm using now?  Hrm...
        Perhaps everything could just come out of that 3-D modeling dataset.  Idk whether we have commercial rights to such data, but oh well

    Michael Black Notes
_____________________________

    Kinect extracts depth, whereas standard camera does not do active lighting of the scene.
    SMPL is "skinning model" instead of triangle based, whatever the fuck THAT means.  Perhaps quadrilaterals?  Perhaps
        Anyway, the answer to the question "what is a skinning model?" lies in the SMPL / DMPL paper.  DMPL is SMPL that takes into account bouncy fat ("soft tissue" as opposed to skeletons, which are estimated with "pose estimation" algorithms)

Laundry (dry it out)

==========================================================================
Code { // begin "Code" TODO segment
    Automate segmentation (3-D Graph Cut AKA Video Cut)
    Do we do end-to-end integration?
        If so, how?
            1.  Assume everyone will be on the bluescreen for simplicity's sake.  Probably best for the MVP anyway.
                a.  Do we deal with smoothing edges?  Is this even important for model generation?  (No; don't do this rn)
                b.  So basically we're delaying on the segmentation bit.  We need to get a webpage up with a Unity model for a proper demo.
==========================================================================
            2.  Try to deal with segmentation in its total complexity and program a Neural Net today (clearly Vishal knows more about NN shit anyway).  As far as implementing Video Cut goes, I'm sure there are poor Ph.Ds we can hire to do that shit

==========================================================================
==========================================================================

    Other thoughts:

    We shouldn't launch on mobile.  We should launch on CPU.  Neither Vishal nor I is a JS / Swift / Droid master, and we want an MVP
        I guess even just launching on web will involve some JS, but I know Flask (kind of) and Vishal understands Unity so he can get Unity launched in-Browser

    "Vector" as June mentioned; should be scalable representation

    Unreal Engine make slightly idealized avatar of a person instead of using their 100% likeness (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9msqaoJZw, 3:30)
    http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/30129/1/02.pdf

    Segmentation should be done w/ multiple methods and "and"ed together.  We can also "fill in" like one would in MS Paint so little "background" "holes" in the body go away, as do "foreground" sections in the actual background.

} // end "Code" TODO segment

UnrealEngine4 "backwards compatilibility": Can I view a site that uses Unreal Engine4 on a very old laptop and still see in high definition?

# Backwards compatible?

### The project:

I want to render a high definition model on my personal website such that it'll be rendered in the highest definition possible on any device, from a 20-year-old Gateway PC running Windows 95 to an iPhoneX. It's particularly important that it's real pretty on mobile (whatever Android and iPhone models are big these days)

### The question: 
I was thinking I'd buy an expensive desktop with GPUs to make sure I can make the app really fancy for users on a high-end desktop with nice monitors. But I'm not going to do that if a mobile user won't be able to see anything the high-definition I get on my new expensive screen doesn't make it out to the app my employer is building. How does this work? Does OpenGL display the highest-definition render it can on the mobile device?

    Blue background for video (segment the ballerina)
        Simple color segmentation (background is green; everything else is foreground)

    "Video Cut" 's insight is that the temporally close images can give information about the current
        Also, matting?
            "Image matting is the process of estimating the foreground, the background and the alpha for each pixel"
            Alpha is the "foreground opacity"
        Some kind of special matting (different from Bayesian)

=======================================================
        A great comment on a School of Life video:
=======================================================
1. Here is the joke love the most about self deception: 

" So there is this guy who suspects that his wife cheats on him. He hires a private detective to find out what's going on. After one week of a business trip he comes back and asks to the detective: 

- So what have you seen?

 - Sir, the first day when you were gone, your wife met this very handsome young man. And then they went to a fancy restaurant. After that they went to see a movie. After the movie, late at night, they went to your place , right to your bedroom. Then they hugged each other for quite a while. 

- And then ?? What happened then?

- Then your wife closed the curtains...

So the husband says:

 - God damn it! You pay a fortune to a private detective to find out the truth and even then, you can't be absolutely sure!! "

Well, the sad thing about this joke is that we are all like this poor guy to a certain extent... We do  what he does on several issues about ourselves, but don't even notice it!  


In this case it can be very valuable to pay attention to what the people who warn us, are saying. Other people may know certain things about you, much better than you!

Because as the very wise proverb goes: 

" You can't read the label from inside the jar". 

2. Two movies that really touched me deeply on this subject are: 

Sunset Boulevard by Billy Wilder
Flight by Robert Zemeckis  ( Denzel Washington is amazing in this movie! )

Of course I won't say what's the end of which one but here is the thing:

You must watch both of them. Because one will show you what will happen to you in the end,  if you keep lying to yourself all your life.  And the other will encourage you  to face the bitter truths about yourself by showing you that no matter how late it may be and how painful, ultimately it will be good for you!  


3. I am totally addicted to the oldest psychology podcast on this planet: " Shrink Rap Radio". There you have a 75 year old shrink, Dr. Dave,  who always interviews another shrink. He is a very wise and very funny man. The best mixture! You can listen to an episode called: 

 " The Lies We Tell Ourselves" with Jon Frederickson.

The man has a book called " The Lies We Tell Ourselves. How To Face  the Truth, Accept Yourself and Create a Better Life".

4. One book we all must read is " The Death of Ivan Ilyich"by Tolstoy. Especially the 9th chapter  is  unforgettable .It shows you in great detail what will happen to you in your death bed if you had an " unexamined" life. Probably the most scary but most important book I have ever read. 

5. Here is a quote by Primo Levi I will never forget. He was a great writer who survived the Holocaust. He said:

 “Monsters exist, but they are too few in number to be truly dangerous. More dangerous are the common men, the functionaries ready to believe and to act without asking questions.”

Well, if you think about it, all those " common men" who ended up being monsters had one thing in common:  their capacity for self delusion. 

It can happen to any of us, that's why we must always be very vigilant, looking always deeply into our actions and motivations. 

6. I always find it really hard, but I am sure that thinking a lot is a very good thing. Only if we can do it properly though. And self deceptions can be cured, especially if an " early diagnosis" is possible. The best tool I know for these purposes is Alain de Botton's "Philosophical Meditation". They have a video about it on this channel.

If you want to give it a try, you should click on the link under that video and print the questions you'll have to ask yourself. In my humble opinion it is the most effective and direct way to your inner world. You just sit down wit a pen and paper and try to answer those questions honestly. And then you know how you REALLY feel.

If you do it often enough, eventually you look forward to it. It is like a meeting with someone you so much wanted to understand: yourself. 

But in the first days, you always feel a certain inner- resistance to it. It is like going to the dentist! You know some things will hurt. I mean some of those questions, when you answer them honestly, cause you more pain in that moment, than if you had ignored them instead.

But it really is always an eye opening experience. It is like a soul cleaning. 

I always repeat this point,  because I can't recommend it enough!

Thank you for this very valuable lesson and for the excellent animation!﻿

4)  do we have to download vcftools?     DONE
   a)  what is vcf?
3)  learn to exclude files in grep / regex / blobs
   a) UNIX power tools book?


4)
Submit YC app?  (get this done the day after meeting Pe'er.  It's also possible we could use more feedback and time to interview possible cofounders  before submitting.  Perfecting the idea is probably more important than interviewing cofounders because that can be done simultaneously; we'll get on Kendall, Alan, Kundan, Kai-Zhan, Luke, Ben Hanser, Kevin Chen, John, whoever else)

This should come second; don't worry too much about this until we have solved concern #1.

Only the Paranoid Survive, (by Andy Grove) page 32




Fri Jan 11 18:22:13 EST 2019
  Applied to a lyft job I'll probably never hear back from.  Mostly submitted my resume online just so I could feel like I'd done SOMETHING today, rather than nothing but thinking.
  I now think getting a job at a startup (ideally a VR startup) will help me in life in multiple ways, first at least in giving me a salary and then also it will give me a shot at getting to know some VCs, meet people who have connections, who have more experience writing software, etc.

  Then locate waist from openpose?  Wait, this all shouldn't be necessary.  I'm probably running away again.

  Dear Mr. Stephens The,
  I was thinking I could start as a consultant for you and help you figure out how to get you started.  A ballpark price range is either $50/hour or $80,000 annually; the annual rate would start with a month's work.

  As far as I can tell, it's actually very simple; you need time, and I need money.  But 

  VM AWS openpose or (preferable) find the best fast way to use openpose on my Ubuntu laptop

  Idea from Mike Twardus:
    1080pix up to 4K TV
________________________________
























  Buy spare laptop battery.
    Anything for the project.
    It won't last long enough.  The shekels give you more optionality than the laptop battery
    When you have a little more $, the battery would be gr8
    DONE!

  Look up if there's a cmd line browser like vim that lets me split-screen

    Modularity.  Anti-Platonicity.  Act by intuition, reflect by data.
































  Pier's idea about machine-learning the hair
  DeepFace (Tuebingen)
    Or some other kinda facial reconstruction















  We're selling TheMall as a boost to self-esteem, status, etc.
    Esp. if you're tall and awkward looking
    We have to take care of EVERYTHING for our customers; fashion tips, formality level, resizing, etc.





















































































Big picture:
  1.  Take video like mTailor does
  2.  Get various measurements from it
    a.  Take a bunch of views, grab the lengths at diff views, make a ConvexHull around those points/lengths, return perim(Hull)
    b.  Make sure arms, lifted legs, other obstructions, etc. don't get in the way.
    c.  How do we calculate the mask angle?  Either we need better segmentation, or there's some secret.  Probably you should just approximate it as the seconds passed.  It'll be good enough.
  3.  BNN (beta neural net)
    a.  "Wiggle" the betas until the perimeters of the SMPL model at various heights match the perimeters we got from the video


  MAYBE there's a perspective / orthographic hidden in there somewhere?
    Wait, but views only matter if the depths are different, right?
    ie. ball and a bat in the picture, Nyle is swinging the bat from far away and the ball's going towards him


  Java
    No pointers
    Fixes errors






























Technical TODOs:
  gad, gci, & gpus.       But with good records toooooo.

  2.  Rotate openpose keypoints.
  1.  Deal with perspective vs. orthographic.  (only a big deal for CHANGES in depth)
  3.  Auto-denoise masks (after img_frames=cut(vid)).
  4.  Scatter plot   openpose keypoints   over gray SMPL render.
  5.  normalize mesh in a smarter, more rule-based way (using the geometry of a human body, rather than any assumptions about the input orientation).
  6.  Search for tool to alert people when git pushes.
  7.
  8.  Go back through old racket code and see whether any of the old triangle functions would be useful in the current approach.
  9.
  10.
  11.
  12.
  13.
  14.
  15.
  16.
  17.
  18.  Have running end-to-end script (vid to final mesh)
      a.  Technical issues:
        1.  conda (openDR, chumpy, etc. in python3 with all the cat stuff)
        2.  openpose is SLOWWWWWWWWW.  Cannot test on my machine; have to purchase AWS/GCloud/Azure time / get GPU access































  cmd:
    grep -r -i --include \*.py --exclude-dir=src file_contents_targ_txt



  The Joel Test

  1.Do you use source control?
    Yes, but I don't really know how git works
  2.Can you make a build in one step?
    No?
  3.Do you make daily builds?
    No.
  4.Do you have a bug database?
    Not a good one
  5.Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
    No.
  6.Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
    No.
  7.Do you have a spec?
    No.
  8.Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
    Yes!
  9.Do you use the best tools money can buy?
    We don't have hella money.  But no.
 10.Do you have testers?
    Just me.
 11.Do new candidates write code during their interview?
    What?
 12.Do you do hallway usability testing?
    Idk what this is.

      Home service provider
    Just do AWS
      Security

    Relational Databases are very well established
      Paul Graham is wrong these days.
      Oracle was 1st.  That's why everyone pays them.  They SUCK. SUCK. SUCK. SUCK. SUCK.
        Microsoft is better than Oracle
        Microsoft has good C++ dev tools.
          VS Code.
          Linux is not as good as Microsoft.

  IDEA!  Manually stretch legs/chest/whatever with a SCALING instead of BNN. Remember, BodyTalk didn't really work.  So it's possible neural net approach ("BNN") won't really either.  If you start with the verts and instead just apply mostly-smooth transformation to stretch, shear, rotate, etc. various body dimensions like chest:waist, etc.
    See more details in BNN.py
    rename fit.py?

  segmentation has to work indoors
  HMR keypoints.json =>  better SMPL.  (fix.  probably the code is mostly already there)

    from opendr.utils import wget
      internet wget() but in python!

  seg.py (deeplab) MUST. work. indoors.
    Can't rely on grassy background.
    May need to be trained on various kinds of indoor data?
      Or we may just need 2 rule out all non-human labels.

  "disgust sensitivity" :  jordan peterson



















































































  Friday & Saturday (Julian)
    Thurs is his GF's birthday.
    Don't tell him what you're doing next time.  Less talking; more listening.




  It's ALL about the zone ("flow state")







  Ask dad/mom about object-oriented next time
  If there's a way to live for free in Manhattan (ie. renovate a dumpster), we should definitely try to live around Columbia.  It's amazing how many random ideas I encounter just sitting in the GS lounge getting work done.  And the mere pressure of other people all being here that I know, familiarity with the environment, etc.  It's the perfect place for a kid to turn a project into the next big thing.  Besides Google (which may, unfortunately, be a bit too task-oriented), a university is the best place to think, to open your mind, to feel good enough about myself to have ambitions, etc.
    Linux was born at a University.  The internet was born at a University.  Uni is the best place for adult play.  And only a spirit of play creates new ideas.  Restriction, depression, excessive focus, all are bad ways to encourage play, exploration, fun work, etc.
      Maybe it's also worth my watching kids shop online during their classes to understand the use case.  It might be best to start it this way before then moving it to Oculus.  Tony's idea is not bad AT ALL.

  Shaina's great, but her family (and sometimes her attitude) are not conducive to the type of shit you're trying to do right now.  Relentless play is the goal; not rote adherence to rules and routine.  Wait, Shaina's definitely not the problem.
    Unfortunately, that basement is ****ing depressing.  I guess Javier is kind of an exception to this rule, but even most of my kids at Results, honestly, are kinda sh!tty.
      Too much base-level survival emphasis and laziness rather than dreaming, ambition, etc.
  Maybe I could get into a Ph.D program here?  Or FB AI or something.  I could always at least ASK Feiner.  It would be good to discuss Lisp with Bob Coyne too
  The impromptu conversations are the ones that are most valuable, not sitting in lecture.  Impromptu with PROFESSORS are good too.

  requirements:
  Enrolled at a German university in a study program related to IT/Computer Vision
If we're determined to do this (and we ARE, because it's the best path for the future),   somehow we need to get a German visa (dad is far too far away to be able to successfully commute).
  The best path is PROBABLY to get into a CS Master's/Ph.D at a shitty university, transfer to MPI, and try to get my Ph.D that way.  I can always ask for a personal favor, but it's very very unlikely I will get special treatment considering A) the sheer number of people asking Black et al. for such favors and B) how much time he/Melanie Feldhofer have in a day.
    But it's still probably worth trying to get in through unofficial channels @ least once before resigning myself to be one of the crowd (tremendous number of the unwashed masses).
    Should I try this way first, or should I see when CS grad schools take applicants?
      Both, but 1st see when they take applicatns so 
      Idk, both are important.  Just DO it.

      Rolling Admission!!!!!!!!!
      "We have no fixed starting date for the Ph.D. While we post calls for applicants throughout the year, you can apply any time by sending your application to ps-apply@tuebingen.mpg.de."


  So, what are the requirements to apply for a Tuebingen Max Planck Ph.D.?
    1.  Statement of intent behind the research project (refine this as much as possible)
    2.  Rec letters
    3.  Familiarity with recent research out of MPI (ie. my project shouldn't be redoing what someone else has already done)
