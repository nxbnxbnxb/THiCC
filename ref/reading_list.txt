      Has links to various papers (kind of a glossary/index of the field of segmentation)




















Meta-learning / big-picture stuff:

 From Wikipedia:
  "Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, and image restoration.[6]"
  For this problem, I want:
   Scene reconstruction
   Pose estimation




 Python:
  # TODO: pltshow() in parallel (ie. like hmr)

    Sounds kinda like what Verma said about unsupervised learning.
      I think it's critically important for real AI that the approaches be more unsupervised
    But right now all I care about is accuracy of human sizing
