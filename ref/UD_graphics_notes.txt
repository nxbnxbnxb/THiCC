  Couldn't we theoretically model every atom/photon in the scene & the lights could just be the result of simulation interactions?
    That would be a HELL of a lot of work, though.

  Shadows are hard  (imagine looking at the view from the light source)
  Self-occlusion (shadow from other part of same object)
  Ambient light
    Ambient occlusion
    What does "ambient" mean?  Sunlight?  Shouldn't it be from a point source?
  Internal reflection
  Shadow map (assumes photons are particles, rather than waves that can diffract around stuff)
    Low resolution of "shadow buffer" / "shadow map" ===> MineCraft-esque shadows
      Penumbra==refraction in shadows ("fuzziness")
    Depth map of shadow buffer == scene from pt of view of the light source
  We can use a texture map as cache (Hash Table) of expensive calculations
    Only possible with static lighting

  Ask about bicubic interpolation?
    "bilinear interpolation"
      Prof: "interpolate between the interpolants"

  "Callback" (when_mousedown___do_x())

  "Rasterization"
    What is this?  Similar at all to interpolation?
  "First class object" :   what's this?
  "Hidden surface elimination"
    Occlusion of object behind other object
  You can write parallelized code for GPU in OpenGL
