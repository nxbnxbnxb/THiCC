  These aren't precisely "bugs," but records of why measure.py doesn't work yet:

  1.  Nipple-height-finding doesn't quite work.
    a.  Ideal solution involves a Conv neural network trained on labeled locations of people's nipples
      1.  And then a vertical shift from the front view to the size view (ie. bottoms of feet should be at same height)
        a.  The vertical shift ought to be more subtly tuned than I was doing earlier.  Perhaps the center of the top and bottom should be in the same place.
    b.  Oh wait but also women can't do that.  Unless we want bust size ON TOP of the breasts.  Hm.  Maybe for clothes that actually IS what we want.
  2.  The assumption that chest circumference is exactly an ellipse overshoots the actual chest measurement.
    a.  Solve by adding a constant?

  Before going into pltshow, I get this bug (seg.py's segment_nparr(self, img), right before the return statement): 

  resized_image going into deeplab
  Clipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).
  saving segmentation map in  _segmented____binary_mask_.jpg
  WARNING:root:Lossy conversion from int64 to uint8. Range [0, 15]. Convert image to uint8 prior to saving to suppress this warning.
