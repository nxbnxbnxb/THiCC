  We're selling TheMall as a boost to self-esteem, status, etc.
    Esp. if you're tall and awkward looking

  This is a real problem you're solving.
    Better than the problem of whether clothing fits, because we can actually DO SOMETHING about it.

  I HATE not fitting in.  I also HATE having to think about/understand clothing
