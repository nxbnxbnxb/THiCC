  

  Get a conda environment working with all the necessary dependencies.  1st step done.
    try to put flask, celery, etc. in there too.
    Scrapy?  Kivy?
  Curr working conda env is cat12 (Sun Mar  3 08:14:45 EST 2019)
    All details ought to be in setup.sh.
    If cat12 works, turn "cat" into the working conda env.
