## Getting started:
### get conda 3
#### Ubuntu (only tested on 16.04):
1st, download anaconda3:   https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux.  I got the python 3.7 version here: 
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh    # this will take a few minutes
./Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
or if you've already done that, 
######configuring a conda environment that runs our code:
```
./setup.sh
```
