## Getting started:
### Get anaconda3:
##### Ubuntu (only tested on 16.04):
First, download anaconda3:   https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux.  I got the python 3.7 version here: 
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh    # this will take a few minutes
./Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
or if you already HAVE conda3,

###### Configuring a conda environment that runs our code:
```
./setup.sh
```

These instructions for configuring conda were written on December 27th, 2018.  So if you're executing this much later than that, Noe can't guarantee perfect functioning.  Please contact the repository's owner (Noe) on github for debugging help
